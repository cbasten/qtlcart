NAME
    Preplot - Process results of LRmapqtl and Zmapqtl for input to gnuplot

SYNOPSIS
    Preplot [ -o *output* ] [ -m *mapfile* ] [ -l *lrfile* ] [ -z *zfile* ]
    [ -q *qtlfile* ] [ -S *threshold* ] [ -T *terminal* ] [ -H *hypo* ] [ -L
    *lod* ]

DESCRIPTION
    Preplot reformats the output of LRmapqtl and Zmapqtl so that it can be
    plotted by GNUPLOT. It requires a molecular map that was used in the
    analysis of the data with LRmapqtl and Zmapqtl.

OPTIONS
    See QTLcart(1) for more information on the global options -h for help,
    -A for automatic, -V for non-Verbose -W path for a working directory, -R
    file to specify a resource file, -e to specify the log file, -s to
    specify a seed for the random number generator and -X stem to specify a
    filename stem. The options below are specific to this program.

    If you use this program without specifying any options, then you will
    get into a menu that allows you to set them interactively.

    -o  This requires a filename stem for output. Preplot will overwrite the
        file if it exists, and create a new file if it does not. If not
        used, then Preplot will use qtlcart. The GNUPLOT file will be
        qtlcart.plt in that case.

    -m  Zmapqtl requires a genetic linkage map. This option requires the
        name of a file containing the map. It should be in the same format
        that Rmap outputs. The default file is qtlcart.map.

    -l  This requires an input filename. This file must exist. It should be
        in the same format as the output of LRmapqtl. The default file is
        qtlcart.lr.

    -q  This requires an input filename. This file may or may not exist. It
        should be in the same format as the output of Rqtl. The default file
        is qtlcart.qtl.

    -z  This requires an input filename. This file must exist. It should be
        in the same format as the output of Zmapqtl. The default file is
        qtlcart.z.

    -T  Allows the user to set the output terminal. Valid options can be
        found in the GNUPLOT manual. The default is *x11* on UNIX, *mac* for
        Macintosh and *windows* for MS-Windows.

    -S  When given an argument, Preplot will use this significance
        threshold. It is 3.84 by default.

    -H  Preplot will get results for this hypothesis test from the Zmapqtl
        outputfile. Test 1 is the default, which is the only value for a
        backcross.

    -L  If given an argument of 1, Preplot will output LOD scores instead of
        the LR test statistics.

EXAMPLES
            % Preplot -L 1

    Preplot will automagically reformat your results to be plotted by
    GNUPLOT, converting the likelihood ratio test statistics into LOD scores
    along the way.

CAVEATS
    Preplot will search for the ouput files from Rqtl, Eqtl and MImapqtl and
    try to process them. If you don't want them processed, rename or move
    the files. Note that Preplot only searches for files with names
    *stem.eqt, stem.qtl* and *stem.mqt*, where *stem* is the filename stem.

BUGS
    Preplot ignores JZmapqtl output.
