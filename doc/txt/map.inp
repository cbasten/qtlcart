#------------------  Documentation for above input file

1.  First line:  it is critical that the first line 
start with a pound symbol, a space, a number, the word 'bychromosome', a -filetype token,
and the map.inp filetype:

# 123456789    bychromosome      -filetype map.inp
 ^          ^                ^            ^
space      space           space        space

The spaces are necessary, because the input is token based. 
The program will read the second token in the file as a long integer
and use it as an identifier for the file.   Thus, each file should
have a unique identifier  following the pound symbol.

The '-filetype map.inp' tells the QTL Cartographer programs that this
is a 'map.inp' formatted file.   The 'bychromosome' word is a vestige of
an idea that simply needs to hang around.


2. Tokens:   A token is any string of non-whitespace
surrounded by whitespace.  Each time a token begins with a -, it is
read to determine what follows it.  The next token is then read and
processed.  The program will ignore any token that it doesn't
recognize.  The tokens that are recognized in a 'map.inp' file are 

-type
-function
-param
-Units
-chromosomes
-maximum
-end
-named
-start
-stop
-skip
-unskip
-Chromosome  

Note that only the first letter of these tokens is actually necessary (except for -start,
-stop and -skip, which require more letters to distinguish between them). 

Case is important.  -Units is different from -units.  -start and -Start are also different.

3.  Meanings of commands:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Token       Followed by           Means
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-type       positions          Marker positions are given 
-type       intervals          Marker intervals are given  
-function   integer 1-8        Code for the map function: Details in manual
-param      real number        Extra parameter needed for some map functions
-Units       cM, M or r        Units are in   centiMorgans (cM),   Morgans (M)  
                               or recombination frequencies (r)                              
-chromosomes  integer > 0      Haploid number of chromosomes
-maximum      integer > 0      Maximum number ofmarkers on any chromosome.  
                               Needed for array allocation.                               
-named      yes  or no         Says whether markers will have names.   
-skip                          Tells Rmap to skip everything until  an
-unskip                        which is the end of the -skip.  These 
                               cannot be within a -start to -stop block
-start                         Start of a map    block
-stop                          End of a map    block
-end                           End of the file
-Chromosome  integer, string   Gives the number of the chromosome (if integer)
                                or the name (if a string)

4.  Map block:

Between the -start token and the -stop token, you should have a repeating
sequence of a -Chromosome token followed by an integer or sting,
then markers ordered, with their names followed by the appropriate distances. 
You should be consistent with the tokens following the -Chromosome token:  Either
have them all be unique chromosome names or unique integers from 1 to the number
of chromosomes indicted with the -chromosomes token.    

This example has the markers followed by their positions in centiMorgans.  
Please give all markers  unique names.

-start 
-Chromosome 1
   Marker1_1    0.0
   Marker1_2   10.2
   Marker1_3   34.1
   Marker1_4   43.3
   Marker1_5   52.1
-Chromosome 2
   Marker2_1    0.0
   Marker2_2   13.7
   Marker2_3   19.1
   Marker2_4   24.8
-stop

In the above,  the line

   Marker1_2   10.2


means that Marker1_2  is on chromosome 1 at position 10.2 cM from the left 
telomere.    If you want to give the chromosomes names, then the above could have been

-start 
-Chromosome X
   Marker1_1    0.0
   Marker1_2   10.2
   Marker1_3   34.1
   Marker1_4   43.3
   Marker1_5   52.1
-Chromosome First
   Marker2_1    0.0
   Marker2_2   13.7
   Marker2_3   19.1
   Marker2_4   24.8
-stop


If -named had a value of 'no' in the preamble, then the format of the distances would be:
-start 
-Chromosome 1      0.0 10.2 34.1 43.3 52.1
-Chromosome 2      0.0 13.7 19.1 24.8
-stop  

That is, the names would be skipped.

You can also create a map where the markers are not on the telomeres.  If you
are inputting the map based on positions, then

-start 
-Chromosome 1
   Marker1_1    5.0
   Marker1_2   10.2
   Marker1_3   34.1
   Marker1_4   43.3
   Marker1_5   52.1
   Telomere    55.3
-Chromosome 2
   Marker2_1    4.0
   Marker2_2   13.7
   Marker2_3   19.1
   Marker2_4   24.8
   Telomere    27.4
-stop

Would mean that there is DNA outside of the first and last markers on a Chromosome.
The keyword 'Telomere' is recognized by Rmap as a telomere and not as a marker.


If you are inputting intervals, then the same map would look like

-start 
-Chromosome 1
   Telomere     5.0
   Marker1_1    5.2
   Marker1_2   23.9
   Marker1_3    9.2
   Marker1_4    8.8
   Marker1_5    3.2
-Chromosome 2
   Telomere     4.0
   Marker2_1    9.7
   Marker2_2    5.4
   Marker2_3    4.7
   Marker2_4    2.6
-stop


That is, you need to indicate that the telomeric DNA comes first.   These two maps
should give the same result when run through Rmap.

WARNING:  do not use 'Telomere' as a marker name.   This keyword is case sensitive,
so 'telomere' is not the same as 'Telomere'.   

5. Annotation:

You can annotate this file as much as you want.  Just don't put in any
extra stuff in the -start to -stop block.  Everything after the -end
token is ignored.  Before the -start token, only the -type, -function,
-param, -units, -chromosomes and -maximum tokens are processed.  The token
following each of these is read and the information used in the
program.

The format of the information between the -start and -stop commands is
unimportant.  You just need whitespaces around each piece of information.  
All the marker names and their distances could be on one line.

6. Usage:  If this file were called 'mapin.inp', then 

% Rmap -i mapin.inp

would convert this file to the format required for the other programs
in the QTLcartographer system.
