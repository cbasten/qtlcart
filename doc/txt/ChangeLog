(919)515-1934


January, 2005,  1.17j
    1.  Fixed bug in MissMark.c that incorrectly estimated genotype 
        probabilities for T(Bi)SFx lines.   Effected all analysis modules.
    2.  Attempting to compile Bmapqtl (Bayesian mapping module)...it's compiled 
        but needs to be debugged.
    3.  Continuing to implement pleitropy v close linkage in JZmapqtl
    4.  The append_seed subroutine in params.c was overwriting the qtlcart.rc
        file:  Changed this to appending.  
    5.  Added an option to Qstats to produce a table of marker probabilities
        (useful for missing or dominant markers). 

October-December, 2004, 1.17i
    1.  Added pleiotropy test to JZmapqtl
    2.  fixed Eqtl bug that missed QTL on very end of last chromosome
    3.  Implementing pleiotropy x close linkage test in JZmapqtl: ongoing
    4.  In Zmapqtl, the sampling variance was calculated using an unbiased estimator.
        To be consistent with the em algorithm, I changed it to the biased estimator with
        n in the denominator rather than n-1.   The result is that r2 = tr2 for
        interval mapping.   Proper estimation of variance components should be done
        with MImapqtl.  
    5.  There was a bug in the output of Emap that printed the wrong marker values. 
        This was fixed.  The .e1c file is correct, but the final .cro file is not.
    6.  Added option to Prune to collapse the map and data to the smallest map with no
        intermarker distances of 0.0.  Useful if you have reestimated the map with
        Emap.   

July, 2004, 1.17h
    1.  Allowed for Permute.pl to get experimentwise thresholds for
        GxE LR scores when using hypothesis test 14 or 34.
    2.  Fixed Prune bug that wouldn't set the proper level of selective 
        genotyping from the command line.  

March-April, 2004, 1.17g
    1.  Updated documentation, namely the INSTALL file and the intro.
    2.  Modified Emap so that you can reestimate the intermarker distances without
        rearranging markers.   Also fixed a bug that gave incorrect telomeric segments
        and crashed when trying to assign names to the telomeres.   
    3.  Changed Prune so that the last random number will be printed as the
         seed in the qtlcart.rc file when doing bootstraps, permutations and
         simulations.   This will cause the programs to switch to reading and
         writing the random number.   This was done so that scripts that did 
         bootstraps would not reuse the same random number seed in consecutive
         iterations. 
 
February, 2004, 1.17f
    1.  Introduced FPN variable so that programs can use
        double or float universally (-DFPN=double, -DFPN=float).
    2.  Fixed output bug in JZmapqtl that effected input of
        MultiRegress for dominance effects. 
    3.  Was able to compile 64 bit binaries under Solaris and
        someone did same for Unix Tru64 v5.1.   See the Makefile
        for the different compiler flags needed.  
    4.  Fixed bug that was tripped in MImapqtl when attempting to output
        residuals and using a working directory.   Working directory was
        prepended twice to the output file name.  
    
August 27, 2003  v1.17e
    1.  Fixed initialization bug in Mdatain.c
    2.  Put on server
    
July, 2003  v 1.17d
    1.  Fixed Mdatain.c bug that wouldn't allow more than 50 chromosomes
        in a map.
    2.  Fixed bug that didn't recognize "position" token in map.inp formatted file.
    3.  Slight changes in Z, JZ and LR-mapqtl output to clarify that the test statistic is
        -2ln(L0/L1) rather than L0/L1.  

April, 2003  v 1.17c
    1.  Fixed Eqtl bug that didn't recognize Zjack.out filetype
        (should have been Zijack.out).  If you have v 1.17b, just insert 
        an 'i' between the 'Z' and 'j' of Zjack.out to work around this bug.
    2.  Altered Preplot so that only up to 20 marker names will be placed on the
        plots.  More than 20 and it gets too cluttered.   
    3.  Changed SAS output routine to use PROC GLM instead of PROC ANOVA.  Updated
        menu message so that values of [0...7] are shown.  
    4.  Fixed Mdatain.c bug that wouldn't read more than 50 markers/chromosome
        
Spring, 2003  v 1.17b
    1.  Released on 8 April 2003

Spring, 2003  v 1.17a

    2.  Added data sets to the examples subdirectory
    3.  Make allowances in Rqtl, Eqtl and Rcross for zero QTL
    4.  Modified Preplot so that marker names would be put on graphs in GNUPLOT

March, 2002  v1.16c
    1.  Fixed MImapqtl bug that crashed when forward searching of epistatic 
        effects
    2.  Fixed bug in MissMark.c that tripped up when markers weren't on the 
        telomeres
    3.  Fixed SSupdate.pl and modified Permute.pl, Bootstrap.pl
    4.  added .csh to c-shell scripts
    5.  Released 28 March 2002

    3.  Released
    
January, 2002 v1.16a
    1.  Cleaned up some of the code.   
    2.  Rewrote the Permute, Model8 and Bootstrap csh scripts in perl.  
    3.  Releases in February, 2002

September-November, 2001 v1.15e
    1.  Fixed bug in calculating expected genotypes for  T(SFx+y)SFy crosses.
    2.  Modified cofactor selection in JZmapqtl model 6:  Now you can set the
        upper bound for ranks and the cofactor summary is printed in the output
    3.  JZmapqtl model 9 produces output file of expected values that can
        be analyzed with new module, MultiRegress
    4.  MultiRegress is new module to map traits onto expected values of 
        QTL genotypes.   Stepwise regression is main algorithm.   This is a
        quick and effective way to get an initial model for MImapqtl
    5.  Minor modifications to MImapqtl for specifying input and output
        model files.   
    
July, 2001  v1.15d
	1.  Added R, SAS and Plabqtl output formats to Rcross
	2.  Added Plabqtl input capability to Rcross
	3.  Native Carbon Apps now part of Mac distribution

May, 2001  v1.15c
    1.  Fixed bug in histogram presented in Qstats output that 
        had 0.0 as an element.  
    2.  Fixed bug in Zmapqtl:  If data set has multiple traits and
        there is missing data, then analysis of all data caused some
        individuals to be deleted if they had missing phenotypes.
    3.  Fixed bug in MImapqtl that used individuals with missing data for
        data sets with multiple traits. 
    4.  Added option to Prune to filter out all but one trait.  Added Prune option
        to do selective genotyping.   
    
April, 2001 v1.15b
	1. Edited man pages and manual in anticipation of the Summer Institute.
	2. Released this version with caveat that it will be tested during Summer
	Institute and released again in June.
	3. Released 24 April 2001

October, 2000  v1.15a
	1. Refined MImapqtl...with a bit more testing it will be ready to roll
	2. Modified Rqtl to simulate epistasis
	3. Modified Rqtl to convert epistatic terms from qtls.inp file
	4. Modified Rcross to use Cockerham's general genetic model and
	   to use epistatic terms from Rqtl
	5. Eliminated qtlcart.hlp file and its usage in programs.   The help.c
	   file was not my code, and I don't want to maintain it.  From now on,
	   the manual and man pages are the documentation.   
	6. Took the histogram out of the LRmapqtl output...it's the same histogram
	   from Qstats.
	7. Eliminated different versions of LocalD.h...now the one version can be used
	   on different platforms with a little bit of editing.   

September, 2000  v1.14f
    1. Created MImapqtl module to do multiple interval mapping.
    2. Unreleased.  Needs to be refined and tested.

       by Zmapqtl in model 8
    2. Allow user to specify maximum number of steps in forward regression in SRmapqtl.
    3. Unreleased

March 31, 2000 v1.14d
    1. Fixed bug in JZmapqtl that picked incorrect markers for CIM
    2. Fixed bug in Eqtl that caused crash in Unix.
    3. Eliminated 068k Macintosh binaries.  All Mac versions will now
       require the PPC chip.
    4. Fixed read_markers bug that tested for ch==EOF before ch had been 
       assigned a value.
    5. Allow for extra map parameter in map.inp file as well as 'Telomere'
       keyword in map to input telomeric DNA.
    6. Released 22 June 2000

November, 1999 v1.14c
    1. Fix Rcross bug that didn't do bogus map when converting a mapmaker file
    2. Calculate quantiles in Qstats
    3. Calculate coefficient of variation, standard errors of skew and kurtosis.
    4. Unreleased
    
July, 1999, v1.14b
    1. Worked on JZmapqtl to fix RI line analysis
    2. Allow for marker names in simulated maps in Rmap
    3. Compiled and tested under CodeWarrior v5...even Wintel binaries work.
    
March 27, 1999 v1.14a
    1. Implement GxE in JZmapqtl
    2. Unreleased
    
February, 1999 v1.13h
	1. Add ability to test for segregation of markers
	2. Produce Watcom binaries without Windows Sioux (says v1.13g)
	3. Get rid of annoying pause at end of programs
	4. Fiddle with Qstats output to make it a little nicer

Late December 1998 v1.13g
  1. Fiddle with code to clean up.
  2. Variances -> Standard deviations in Rmap, now
     standard deviations of output are from map.  Rmap always
     used standard deviations...I had just misslabelled them 
     variances.
  3. Cleaned up Rmap and Rqtl output. 
  4. Eliminated MLinpak.c...now all are in Linpak.c.  Added 
     files MLnpkws.c and Lnpkws.c to account for different 
     structures for multitrait analysis.
  5. -X stem on command line sets the stem.  Also, added 
     quit option from menu that updates resoure file.
  6. Pared down Preplot so that automagic mode is only mode left
  7. Added ability to change random markers to dominant in Prune.
  8. Global buffer and name spaces (gbuffer, gname, gwarn) to decrease
     system overhead and allocate/deallocate calls.  A few bugs resulted,
     but I think I've caught them all.
  9. Verbosity output is now a bit nicer
 10. Cleaned up JZmapqtl output on the way to integration with other programs
 11. Zmapqtl can now do analysis for more than one trait (serially) in one
     run.   Traits to be analyzed are specified as in JZmapqtl.  Only models
     3 and 6 will work, and not permutations, bootstraps or jackknives 
     are allowed.
 12. When you run Eqtl, it finds the maximal LR value and saves it in 
     qtlcart.rc.  This is a ratching value, in that it will only increase
     with each run of Eqtl.  Also, if you switched to LOD scores, it will
     be saved as a LOD score.  This max value will then be use by Preplot
     to set the y range.  The y range will be bigger than the max. LR and
     will take on values 50, 100, 200, 300, 400, 500 or 1000, whichever 
     is smallest and still larger than max LR.      
 13. Eqtl also processes JZmapqtl output and summarizes it in the .eqt file.
 14. Eqtl now outputs in Rqtl.out format and the more readable format.
     Rcross can now read the file by going directly to the first block
     of Rqtl.out formatted text.   The output mode is thus discontinued.
  
 15. Released, 4 January 1999.
 
14 December 1998 v1.13f
  1. Converted to using function prototypes.
  2. Found a few bugs associated with function calls.
  3. Reorganized header files.   All load through Main.h.
  4. SRmapqtl no longer bombs.   Use Metroworks Codewarrior under NT now.
     Use of function prototypes caught bug whereby double * were passed
     as int *.  Had no effect in Mac or UNIX, but killed NT version.
  5. Unreleased

9 September 1998 v1.13e
  1. Fixed bug in Idatain.c with respect to translating categorical traits from the
     cross.inp file when given by individuals.
  2. Unreleased

  3. Preliminary JZmapqtl module
  4. Released   

25 August 1997 v1.12f

  2. Fixed bug in Zmapqtl:  added #include in Zfunc.c
  3. Added trait name to Zmapqtl output
  4. Released in August, 1997   

2 June 1997 v1.12e
  1. Modified Rcross so that tokens in the 'data' line can be upper or lower
     case. 
  2. Unreleased.   

30 April 1997 v1.12d
  1. Added jackknifing to Zmapqtl.  
  2. Modified Eqtl to read jackknife interim results and
     calculate relevant statistics. 
  3. Released 29 May 1997 after some testing and major updates in the manual
     and man pages.   

2 April 1997 v1.12c
  1. Completed most of updates for bootstrapping with Zmapqtl.  
  2. Eliminated the interactive setting of endpoints for Zmapqtl analysis.
  3. Modified Eqtl to read permutation test and bootstrap interim results and
     calculate relevant statistics. 
  4. Unreleased.   

31 March 1997 v1.12b
  1. Modified Prune so that it could produce a 'permuted' dataset, like
     produces a 'bootstrapped' data set.  
  2. Prune now has limited automatic activities (bootstrapping, permuting
     or simulating missing data).  Other activities must be done in
     an interactive menu.
  3. Modified Zmapqtl to single bootstrap analysis and print interim results.
     The interim results are the sum and sum of squares at each test site
     for LR, a and d. 
  4. Unreleased.   

26 March 1997 v1.12a
  1. Created SRmapqtl to do stepwise regression.  Running it will
     be necessary to determine which markers to use in the background
     for CIM.
  2. Modified Zmapqtl to use the results from SRmapqtl.
  3. Modified Zmapqtl to print out interim results of Permutation tests. 
  4. Unreleased.   

12 March 1997 v1.11i
  1. Added an internal hook to recognize filetypes.  
  2. Unreleased.   

27 February 1997 v1.11h
  1. Added option in Preplot and Eqtl to output LOD scores rather than
     likelihood ratios.  
  2. Modified simulation of Ri0, Ri1 and Ri2 designs so that they are more
     accurate.
  3. Unreleased.   

20 February 1997 v1.11g
  1. I am in the process of incorporating multitrait analysis.  As a 
     result, some internal structures have been changed.  The user should
     notice no changes from 1.11f due to these modifications.  
  2. Sue Carson wanted some special experimental designs for pine tree
     crosses.  These are called SC1 and SC2, although the SC2 doesn't
     behave as expected.  Actually, SC1 is all that is needed.  Basically,
     one starts with a pair of individuals in which the markers are dominant
     (in the P1), and the QTLs are random accross loci.  Then you get a 
     large number of offspring to look for correlations.
  3. Unreleased.   

14 August 1996 v1.11f
  1. Made a definition for the range of the values of the quantitative
     trait.  MISS_VAL = -1,000,000.  This can be changed in Utilities.h
     from now on.  This also fixes the print_histogram subroutine which
     was incorrectly determining the min and max values.  
  2. Modification of the interactive menus for Rmap, Rqtl and Rcross:
     If one chooses to translate a file by specifying an input file,
     then the simulation parameters dissappear.   They can come back by
     eliminating the input file.
  3. Unreleased.   

13 August 1996 v1.11e
  1. Made it possible for the programs to recognize a change in the 
     random number seed, either on the command line or the interactive
     menu.
  2. Unreleased.   

4 June 1996 v1.11d
  1. Fixed a bug in MissMark.c...it wasn't initializing a matrix for 
     T(SFx)SFy crosses.
  2. Unreleased.   

10 May 1996 v1.11c
  1. Fixed a bug in Rcross that caused it to not translate a *.raw file
     without a molecular map.
  2. Unreleased.   

9 May 1996 v1.11b
  1. Added subroutine to check parameters.  If verbosity is on, will
     tell which parameters changed.  All programs except Preplot and
     Prune will have this feature.
  2. Redid the gnuplot_map subroutine so that it puts the output files
     in the proper subdirectory, and can do more than 10 chromosomes.
     Had to modify term pointer in Preplot as a result.
  3. Unreleased.   

5 May 1996 v1.11a
  1. Model 7 in Zmapqtl uses previous results to produce virtual
     markers for the control of the genetic background.  It will produce
     virtual markers at the positions estimated by a previous run of
     Zmapqtl using one of Models 1-6 and summarized by Eqtl.
  2. Unreleased.  Requires testing. 

2 May 1996 v1.10b
  1. Bug in Rcross that neglected to make individual names lower case
     for traits and otraits when case is ignored.
  2. LRmapqtl requires that rows be initialized to 1.
  3. Released 3 May 1996   

23 April 1996 v1.10a
  1. Added ability to simulate missing data in Prune.
  2. Added ability to use postscript and hpljii terminal types in Preplot.
  3. Allow for the Model to be a part of the plot file name in Preplot output.
     (  c#t#.lb would now be c#t#.z3, etc).
  4. Unreleased.   

17 April 1996 v1.09c
  1. Fixed bug in LRmapqtl and Zmapqtl that affected Windows versions.
  2. Released.  17 April 1996

  2. Unreleased.  

2 April 1996 v1.07b
  1. Eqtl prints out trait names with the estimates of their QTL.
  2. Unreleased.  

29 March 1996 v1.07a
  1. Preplot: major change.  Now there is an 'automagic' mode. 
     It is default and will simply process all results to the
     best of its abililty
  2. Unreleased.  Need to test on Windows, Unix.

28 March 1996 v1.06b
  1. Eqtl: fixed a bug that picked up the wrong QTL.  
     Still need to do checking for incomplete results.
     Still need to process lrfile, and add new formats.
  2. Unreleased.

27 March 1996 v1.06a
  1. Eqtl: reengineered to hopefully process all results in the
     Eqtl.out file.  Still needs a few bug fixes.
  2. Unreleased.

21 March 1996 v1.05f
  1. Zmapqtl:  added in a bailout facility to the ECM algorithm.
  2. Unreleased.

15 March 1996 v1.05e

  3. Fixed bug in Prune (print_individuals had wrong arg list)
  4. Released in all versions
    
1 March 1996 v1.05b
  1. Rcross: if no marker or trait names, will create bogus ones.
     This will allow the translation of simulated data sets into
     MAPMAKER and cross.inp formats.  
  2. In interactive menu: A solitary period wipes the option.
  3. Found a couple of bugs in the output subroutines for Mapmaker
     and cross.inp output formats.

  2. Begin testing of Rcross, LRmapqtl and Zmapqtl.
  3. Unreleased.

21 February 1996 v1.04a
  1. Started modification of Rcross to do more complex simulations.
  2. Unreleased.

21 February 1996 v1.03a
  1. Continued implementation of Jiang and Zeng's methods to infer
     genotypes based in flanking marker information.  This 
     affected LRmapqtl.
  2. Unreleased.

19 February 1996 v1.02a
  1. Began implementation of Jiang and Zeng's methods to infer
     genotypes based in flanking marker information.  This 
     affected Zmapqtl.
  2. Unreleased.

15 February 1996 v1.01j
  1. Reading in a MAPMAKER output file with one chromosome had
     a problem which was fixed.
  2. Changed the choices for the model in Zmapqtl to be (1-6).
  3. Released at 11:30am EST.
  
14 February 1996 v1.01i
  1. Permutation tests and bootstraps don't work for Windows
     platform so they have been disabled.  This is probably a 
     defect of the compiler or OS, as it is not a problem with
     the Mac or Unix versions.  Permutations and bootstraps 
     should probably be done in the UNIX environment anyway.
  2. Minor change in the printout of the parameter values in
     the interactive menu.  Just an English correction.
  3. Unreleased.
  
13 February 1996 v1.01h

     from LRmapqtl.  
  2. Unreleased.

13 February 1996 v1.01g
  1. Zmapqtl was incorrectly picking markers to control for the
     genetic background when using model 5.  This was fixed.  

13 February 1996 v1.01f
  1. The EM algorithm fails for some data sets.  In Windows,
     an annoying clickbox would appear. This was disabled.
  2. Unreleased.
  
12 February 1996 v1.01e
  1. Fixed bug in LRmapqtl that caused it to crash when doing a 
     permutation test.  
  2. Added a print statement to indicate which permutation the 
     program was on.
  3. Unreleased, because other enhancements were anticipated.
     
 2 February 1996 v1.01d
  1. Previously, EOF was checked for by comparing with a char variable.
     Changed this variable to int where ever EOF occurred.  The programs
     now run on IBM AIX and Silicon Graphics machines.  Only UNIX
     version was released.

13 January 1996 v1.01c
  1.  Put an sprintf statement in Qstats so that the Windows version
      wouldn't crash.  There may be a bug in the Borland C v4.5 
      compiler.  It makes no sense.
  2.  Version bumped from 1.01b to 1.01c
  3.  Put on the archive at 4:30 pm EST (only WinTel version).
