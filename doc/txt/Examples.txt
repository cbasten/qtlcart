NAME
    Examples - Example data sets for QTL Cartographer

DESCRIPTION
    The files in the example subdirectory are example data sets that can be
    used with QTL Cartographer. Some of these data sets have been published,
    so you can compare your results with those in the publications.

    If you are on a Unix system, you can use make to create a test
    subdirectory, with a different subdirectory for each set of example
    files. Be sure to check the Makefile for proper rm and cp commands. You
    will also want to set the target location for the test directory.

COPYING
    The file COPYING contains the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE (Version 2,
    June 1991) that governs the usage of QTL Cartographer. It does not cover
    the usage of the data sets in this directory. You can use these data
    sets to learn about or teach QTL Cartographer. Contact the people who
    generated the data if you want to use their data sets for other
    purposes. We are grateful to the individuals who created the data for
    allowing us to distribute their data sets.

INPUT FORMAT
    The genetic linkage map files will generally have to be converted using
    Rmap, and the data sets should be run through Rcross. For example, the
    sample subdirectory contains files sample.mps and sample.raw. You will
    convert them with the commands

            % Rmap -i sample.map -X sample
            % Rcross -i sample.raw 

    The above commands will output files sample.map and sample.cro.

    The only exception to this general rule is the mletest files, which are
    already in QTL Cartographer format.

EXAMPLES
    Here is a list of the example data files contained in this directory.

    1.  mletest.map and mletest.cro contain the simulated data generated and
        used by Zhao Bang Zeng in his original paper on composite interval
        mapping (Zeng, 1994).

        These are ready for use with QTL Cartographer. There is also a file
        mletestq.inp which contains the true positions and effects of the
        QTL used in the simulation. It can be translated with Rqtl

                %  Rqtl -i mletestq.inp -X mletest

        and then you can proceed with the analysis

                % Qstats
                % LRmapqtl
                % SRmapqtl
                % Zmapqtl
                % Zmapqtl -M 6
                % Eqtl -S 12.0
                % Preplot
                % gnuplot mletest.plt

        You can modify the above commands to explore how to use QTL
        Cartographer.

    2.  The files realdatc.inp and realdatm.inp contain real data from
        Horvat and Medrano (1995). These should be converted with Rmap and
        Rcross before use with QTL Cartographer.

                % Rmap -i realdatm.inp -X realdat
                % Rcross -i realdatc.inp
                % Qstats
                % LRmapqtl
                % SRmapqtl
                % Zmapqtl
                % Zmapqtl -M 6
                % Eqtl -S 12.0
                % Preplot
                % gnuplot realdat.plt

    3.  MAPMAKER/EXP and MAPMAKER/QTL (Lander *et al* 1987) come with a
        sample data set which we have included in the QTL Cartographer
        distribution. sample.raw is the sample data set and sample2.raw is
        essentially the same data but the trait foo=log(weight) has been
        calculated and put in the file. The sample.raw file was run through
        MAPMAKER/EXP to create the sample.mps file in preparation to use
        with QTL Cartographer.

        These should be converted with Rmap and Rcross before use with QTL
        Cartographer.

                % Rmap -i sample.mps -X sample
                % Rcross -i sample2.raw

        or

                % Rmap -i sample.mps -X sample
                % Rcross -i sample2.raw

        and then you can run the rest of the analyses

                % Qstats
                % LRmapqtl
                % SRmapqtl
                % Zmapqtl
                % Zmapqtl -M 6
                % Eqtl -S 12.0
                % Preplot
                % gnuplot sample.plt

    4.  Nuhzdin *et al* (1997) present an analysis of sex-specific QTL Data
        coming from Trudy MacKay's lab. These data are contained in
        nuzhdinm.inp (the map) and nuzhdinc.inp (the data). They should be
        converted with Rmap and Rcross before use with QTL Cartographer.

                % Rmap -i nuzhdinm.inp -X nuzhdin
                % Rcross -i nuzhdinc.inp

    5.  The data from Weber *et al* (1999) and Weber *et al* (2001) are in
        the files weber519c.inp and weber701c.inp and there is a map file
        for each. The numbers in the file name indicate the sample sizes.
        For the sample of size 519, convert the files prior to analysis:

                % Rmap -i weber519m.inp -X weber519
                % Rcross -i weber519c.inp

        For sample of size 701, use weber701m.inp and weber701c.inp

                % Rmap -i weber701m.inp -X weber701
                % Rcross -i weber701c.inp

        and proceed with the analyses.

    6.  Another data set from Trudy Mackay's lab was presented by Vieira *et
        al* (2000). The data are in vieiram.inp and vieirac.inp. The by-now
        usual conversion should preceed the analysis.

                % Rmap -i vieiram.inp -X vieira
                % Rcross -i vieirac.inp

    7.  There are four data sets from Cathy Laurie's lab with analyses
        presented by Zeng *et al* (2000).

        The map file (lauriem.inp) should be used with all four of the data
        sets. The data sets include two backcrosses between *Drosophila
        simulans* and *D. mauritiana*. Each backcross has two independent
        samples. Think of *D. mauritiana* as parental line 1 (P1) and *D.
        simulans* as parental line 2 (P2). Then, we have B1 crosses (F1 x
        P1) and B2 crosses (F1 x P2). The first B1 cross has a sample size
        of 192 and is in the file lauriem4c.inp, while the second
        (lauriem6c.inp) has a sample size of 299. The first B2 cross has a
        sample size of 184 ( lauries4c.inp), while the second
        (lauries6c.inp) has a sample size of 287.

        All need to be converted.

                % Rmap -i lauriem.inp -X lauriem4
                % Rcross -i lauriem4c.inp

                % Rmap -i lauriem.inp -X lauries4
                % Rcross -i lauries4c.inp

                % Rmap -i lauriem.inp -X lauriem6
                % Rcross -i lauriem6c.inp

                % Rmap -i lauriem.inp -X lauries6
                % Rcross -i lauries6c.inp

        You might want to create a separate subdirectory for each data.

    8.  Arabidopsis data from Rauh *et al* (2002) are in rauhall.inp with
        the map in rauhmap.inp. There are four different traits raised in
        four different environments. Each of the traits has been split into
        a file of its own. Rootmass data are in rauhrm.inp, rootlength data
        in rauhrl.inp, arialmass data in rauham.inp and the ratio of root to
        arial mass in rauhratio.inp. Again, they need to be converted, and
        each dataset should its own subdirectory. For example, if you have
        all the files in one subdirectory, you could analyze the rootmass
        data as follows:

                % mkdir rootmass
                % cp rauhmap.inp rauhrm.inp rootmass
                % cd rootmass
                % Rmap -i rauhmap.inp -X rootmass
                % Rcross -i rauhrm.inp
                % Qstats
                % LRmapqtl -t 5
                % SRmapqtl -t 5
                % Zmapqtl -t 5
                % Zmapqtl -t 5 -M 6
                % JZmapqtl -t 5 -I 14
                % Eqtl -S 12.0 -H 14
                % Preplot
                % gnuplot rootmass.plt
