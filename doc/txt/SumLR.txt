NAME
    SumLR.pl - Calculate the sum and sum of squares for the LRs in a Zmapqtl
    file

SYNOPSIS
       SumLR.pl [-C column] [-i] [-h] [-j] [-r rep] [-t trait] < input > output

DESCRIPTION
    SumLR.pl reads from the standard input and writes to the standard
    output. It can do one of two things. The first is to initialize a file
    of likelihood ratio sums and sums of squares. The second is to read the
    results of a run of Zmapqtl from a the user-specified column, and to
    calculate the sum and sum of squares of those likelihood ratios. It is a
    Perl script meant to be run in a loop with Prune and Zmapqtl or
    JZmapqtl.

OPTIONS
    -C  This option requires an integer value. It allows the user to specify
        the Zmapqtl.out file column for processing.

    -i  requires no operand. If used, the script outputs a ZipermE.out
        header to the standard output and exits. It does require an input
        file of the Zmapqtl.out format. SumLR.pl will get the model, cross,
        window size and number of background parameters from the Zmapqtl.out
        file.

    -h  requires no operand. If used, it prints a usage message and exits.

    -j  requires no operand. It is a flag to indicate that the input file is
        a joint-mapping file from JZmapqtl.

    -r  requires the repetition number for the bootstrap or permutation
        test.

    -t  used with an integer is simply a way to pass on the trait value when
        using JZmapqtl. It should only be used in conjuntion with the -j and
        -i options.

EXAMPLE
    This Perl program was meant to be run in a shell script. Here is an
    example of a c shell program that allows the user to calculate the
    experimentwise threshold as well as comparisonwise values.

    Suppose you had a data set corn.cro and a map file corn.map. To use the
    above shell script, create a directory called cornperm and copy the two
    files into it. Run Qstats on the files to initialize the qtlcart.rc
    file, and SRmapqtl to rank a set of markers for use with composite
    interval mapping. Make sure that the QTL Cartographer programs and
    scripts are installed in the /usr/local/bin subdirectory (or change the
    line setting qbin above). The script above is set to do 1,000
    permutations using interval mapping and restricting itself to column
    four of the Zmapqtl.out file. Run it as follows:

            % Permute   &

    The script will email you a message when it is complete.

    Note that the above example uses -C 4 for the SumLR line in the loop. If
    you want to use a different column of likelihood ratios, you can change
    that option.

    Once finished, you will need to go through the file created by SumLR.pl
    to calculate the mean and standard error over all sites and all
    repetitions.

    The Permute script above has been rewritten as a Perl script and is
    described in a man page Permute.pl(1).
