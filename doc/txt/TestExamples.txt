NAME
    TestExamples.pl - Run a basic analysis on the example files

SYNOPSIS
      TestExamples.pl [-D debug] [-t test dir ] [-e example dir ][-b bin dir ] [-h]   

DESCRIPTION
    TestExamples.pl is a script that will use the QTL Cartographer commands
    to run basic analyses on all of the example data sets.

OPTIONS
    -b  This option requires the path to the QTL Cartographer binaries and
        perl scripts.

    -t  This option requires the path to the base directory for doing the
        analyses. This directory will be created if it doesn't exist. Each
        data set will have a subdirectory in the base directory for
        analysis.

    -e  Use this to specify the location of the example subdirectory.

    -D  Allows you to set the debug level. The default is zero. You can set
        it to any of 0, 1, 2, or 3.

    -h  requires no operand. If used, it prints a usage message and exits.

EXAMPLE
    Suppose that the example files are in /home/user/QTLCartUnix/example and
    you want to run all the tests in a base directory /home/user/test.
    Suppose further that you have installed the QTL Cartographer binaries in
    /usr/local/bin. Use

        % TestExamples.pl -b /usr/local/bin -t /home/user/test \
            -e /home/user/QTLCartUnix/example

    This will create the directory /home/user/test if it doesn't exist, and
    then create subdirectories for each data set. It will copy the data file
    and genetic linkage map from the example subdirectory into the data set
    subdirectory of /home/user/test. Then, it will convert the map and data
    files into the proper formats and run Qstats, LRmapqtl, SRmapqtl,
    Zmapqtl on all traits. If there are multiple traits, JZmapqtl will be
    run followed by Eqtl and Preplot. Then, JZmapqtl will convert the data
    so that MultiRegress can generate an initial model that Rqtl translates
    and MImapqtl refines. This will be done for all the data sets in the
    example directory that have filename extension .inp.

    The script also runs analyses for the mletest and sample data sets, and
    does two simulations: One with a single trait and one with two traits.

    At the end of the script, you will find a file
    /home/user/test/Verbiage.txt that contains all of the verbal output from
    the programs. This file is deleted by the script if you run it again.

NOTE
    You will need at least 36 megabytes of disk space to run this program.
