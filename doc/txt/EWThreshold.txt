NAME
    EWThreshold.pl - Calculate the Experimentwise Threshold from a
    permutation test

SYNOPSIS
      EWThreshold [-s size] [-h]   < input  > output

DESCRIPTION
    EWThreshold.pl reads from the standard input and writes to the standard
    output. It reads the results of permutation test that are in the format
    of ZipermE.out. It sorts the likelihood maxima from that file and prints
    out the 100(1 - size)th percentile.

OPTIONS
    -s  This option requires an a real value. It should be the size of the
        test, that is the Type I error probability. The default is 0.05.

    -h  requires no operand. If used, it prints a usage message and exits.

EXAMPLE
    After running the example outlined in the GetMaxLR manpage, you can run

            % EWThreshold.pl -s 0.01 < corn.z3.e

    to get the experimentwise threshold for a 1% test. The threshold will be
    printed to the standard output.
