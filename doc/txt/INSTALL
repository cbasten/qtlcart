                        INSTALL file for QTL Cartographer.


0.  I assume that you downloaded the distribution from
http://statgen.ncsu.edu/qtlcart and have unpacked
and untarred it.   

1.  CD into the QTLCartUnix/src directory, and edit the Makefile.  You will need to
pick a compiler.  The default is cc, but you may have gcc available.  
You will need a compiler that understands function prototypes.   
If you don't have one, then get gcc.  

You will want to set the install directory.  It is a line that looks like

BINDIR = ../bin

You can change it to whatever you wish.  If you want it
globally available, you might try using 

BINDIR = /usr/local/bin

But you will need write permission on that directory for it to work.

Check the install command and change it to whatever works on your system.
Presently it is 

INSTALL = /bin/cp

You may need to make it

INSTALL = /usr/bin/cp


2.  Compile flags

You may need to look at the LocalD.h file if the compilation does not work.
There are a few compile flags that can be changed.  One is FPN, which allows
you to compile floating point numbers as "double" or "float".  The default
is double.  

I develop on a Macintosh running MacOSX, and use the following:

CPPFLAGS=-DUNIX -DITOA -DAQUA

If you are not on a Macintosh, then remove the -DAQUA from the above line.   

If you have a machine running Solaris and the SUNW compilers, then you can compile
64 bit binaries.   These will be slower, but potentially allow for larger data sets.
This has not been extensively tested.  Look at the Makefile for details.

2.  Now, make the programs 

% make  

If you get an error, edit the LocalD.h file or contact Chris Basten.
You can try commenting and uncommenting some of the lines in it and
remaking.  

If make succeds, then install the programs

% make install


3.  The binaries will be in the BINDIR subdirectory.  Make sure that this
subdirectory is in your path variable, and then rehash.


4. There are  example data sets in the example subdirectory. 


5.  See the README.doc file in the doc subdirectory for more documentation.

6.  As a test, create a new subdirectory.  Change into it and run the
programs in the following order:

   1. Rmap
   2. Rqtl
   3. Rcross
   4. Qstats
   5. LRmapqtl
   6. SRmapqtl
   7. Zmapqtl
   8. Eqtl
   9. Preplot

You can use the default parameters for each.  This sequence should give
you an idea of whether the programs were compiled correctly.  

7.  There are some perl and csh scripts in the doc/src subdirectory.
Read the INSTALL file in that directory for instructions.
