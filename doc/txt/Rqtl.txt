NAME
    Rqtl - Place a set of estimated or randomly generated QTLs on a
    molecular map.

SYNOPSIS
    Rqtl [ -o *output* ] [ -i *input* ] [ -m *mapfile* ] [ -b *beta* ] [ -t
    *Traits* ] [ -q *QTLperTrait* ] [ -d *dominance* ] [ -1 *beta1* ] [ -2
    *beta2* ] [ -E *prop* ] [ -M Rmode ]

DESCRIPTION
    Rqtl will translate a genetic model or simulate a random model for use
    by Rcross to simulate a data set. It places a specified number of QTLs
    (Quantitative Trait Loci) on the molecular map created or translated by
    Rmap. For simulations, they are placed randomly on the map, and the
    additive, dominace and epistatic effects are also determined. The
    molecular map could be a random one produced by Rmap, or a real one in
    the same format as the output of Rmap.

OPTIONS
    See QTLcart(1) for more information on the global options -h for help,
    -A for automatic, -V for non-Verbose -W path for a working directory, -R
    file to specify a resource file, -e to specify the log file, -s to
    specify a seed for the random number generator and -X stem to specify a
    filename stem. The options below are specific to this program.

    If you use this program without specifying any options, then you will
    get into a menu that allows you to set them interactively.

    -o  This requires a filename for output. Rqtl will overwrite the file if
        it exists, and create a new file if it does not. If not used, then
        Rqtl will use qtlcart.qtl.

    -i  This requires an input filename. This file must exist. Rqtl will
        attempt to identify the format of the file and translate it to
        another format. This file should contain a genetic model defining a
        set of QTL and including their positions and effects. See the file
        qtls.inp for the format.

    -m  This requires a filename that must exist. Rqtl will read the genetic
        linkage map from this file.

    -t  This allows the user to specify the number of traits to simulate. It
        is 1 by default.

    -q  This requires an integer argument. It allows the user to specify the
        number of QTL that affect the trait. If one trait is simulated, then
        exactly this number of QTL will be created. If more than one trait
        are simulated, then the number of QTL per trait will vary but have
        mean value specified here. The default is 9.

    -d  You can specify the type of dominance at the trait loci. If we
        assume inbred parental lines with line one marker trait alleles all
        Q and line two trait alleles all q, then use a 1 for no dominance, a
        2 for complete dominance of Q over q, a 3 for complete dominance of
        q over Q, and a 4 for dominance that is random in direction and
        magnitude for each locus. It is 1 by default, that is no dominance.

    -b  Specifies the parameter needed to determine the additive effect of a
        QTL. It is 0.5 by default. See Zeng (1992) equation (12) and
        accompanying text for a discussion of this parameter. Itis not the
        allelic effect of a QTL allele, rather it is the shape parameter in
        the beta distribution.

    -1, -2
        Allows you to specify the two parameters used to determine the
        dominance effect of a QTL. The effect is simulated from a beta
        distribution. See the manual for more details.

    -E  For a *k* QTL model, there will be *2k(k+1)* potential epistatic
        terms. This option sets the proportion of epistatic interactions
        that will be non-zero in a simulated model. The effects are
        generated with the same beta funtion used for the dominance effects.

    -M  By default, Rqtl will not place a new QTL on the same interval or an
        adjacent interval. If you use this option with a value of 1, then it
        will allow QTL in adjacent intervals. The value of this option will
        be returned to 0 at the completion of the program.

INPUT FORMAT
    The input format of the molecular map should be the same as that of the
    output format from the program Rmap.

    If a file is specified with the -i option, then that file will be read
    for the positions and effects of the QTLs. The format of this file
    should be identical to that of the output of Rqtl, or of a special
    format defined in the file qtls.inp included with the distribution.

EXAMPLES
            % Rqtl   -d 2

    Places 9 QTLs on the map in Rmap.out. There is complete dominance of A
    over a.

            % Rqtl   -i qtls.inp -o test.qtl

    Reads the file qtls.inp and translates it into the output format of
    Rqtl. The output is written to the file test.qtl, which is overwritten
    if it exists.

BUGS
    The -t option for the number of traits is rather primitive at this time.
    The number of QTLs and their effects are randomly determined, with means
    given in the other options.
