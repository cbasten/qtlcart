NAME
    Eqtl - Summarize the output of Zmapqtl

SYNOPSIS
    Eqtl [ -o *output* ] [ -z *zmapfile* ] [ -m *mapfile* ] [ -t *trait* ] [
    -M *Model* ] [ -a *size* ] [ -S *threshold* ][ -L *lod* ] [ -I
    *workcode* ]

DESCRIPTION
    Eqtl reformats the prodigous output of Zmapqtl. The output file has a
    section that is suitable for input to Rcross. There are other sections
    to the output that are more readable. Eqtl can also detect whether a
    bootstrap, permutation or jackknife analysis was performed and process
    the interim files produced by those analyses.

OPTIONS
    See QTLcart(1) for more information on the global options -h for help,
    -A for automatic, -V for non-Verbose -W path for a working directory, -R
    file to specify a resource file, -e to specify the log file, -s to
    specify a seed for the random number generator and -X stem to specify a
    filename stem. The options below are specific to this program.

    If you use this program without specifying any options, then you will
    get into a menu that allows you to set them interactively.

    -o  This requires a filename for output. Eqtl will overwrite the file if
        it exists, and create a new file if it does not. If not used, then
        Eqtl will use qtlcart.eqt.

    -z  This requires an input filename. This file must exist. It should be
        in the same format as the output of Zmapqtl. The default file is
        qtlcart.z.

    -m  Eqtl requires a genetic linkage map. This option requires the name
        of a file containing the map. It should be in the same format that
        Rmap outputs. The default file is qtlcart.map.

    -H  Allows the user to specify which hypothesis test results to process.
        Use values 10 or 14 for data with two marker classes, and 30, 31,
        32, 34 for those with three marker classes.

    -S  Tells Eqtl the significance threshold. It assumes that the test
        statistic is significant if greater than this value. It is 3.84 by
        default.

    -a  Eqtl uses the specified size (alpha) to determine the significance
        threshold from the experiment-wise permutation results. If used, the
        -S option is ignored, and the significance threshold is set and
        saved from the experiment-wise permutation test results. The size is
        0.05 by default.

    -L  If used with argument 1, it causes LOD scores to be output rather
        than the LR statistics. It is 0 by default.

    -I  This should be followed by a string of no more than eight
        characters. It allows the user to control which files Eqtl will
        process. The default is *ZM*, which means process the results of
        Zmapqtl and JZmapqtl (the *M* is for multitrait). You can also add
        the letters *P* for permutations, *B* for bootstraps or *J* for
        jackknives. Prior to implementing this option, the default was
        *PBJZM*. Note that the order of the letters indicates the order of
        processing: If you want to use the threshold from a permutation
        test, then the *P* should precede the *Z* and *M* values. Also, you
        need to have at least one action.

INPUT FORMAT
    The input format of the molecular map should be the same as that of the
    output format from the program Rmap. The input format of the individual
    data should be the same as the output format of the program Rcross. The
    other files should have been created by Zmapqtl. Take care that Zmapqtl
    completed its analysis: An incomplete qtlcart.z file can cause Eqtl to
    crash.

EXAMPLES
            % Eqtl -m example.map -z example.z -S 13.2

    reprocesses the results of example.z based on the map in example.map
    using a significance threshold of 13.2. If you had run JZmapqtl, then
    those results would also have been processed.

BOOTSTRAPS, JACKKNIVES AND PERMUTATIONS
    If Zmapqtl was used to do a bootstrap experiment or a permutation test,
    then there will be interim results files. With the default filename stem
    and model 3, there will be files qtlcart.z3c and qtlcart.z3e if a
    permutation test was done, and qtlcart.z3a if a bootstrap was done.
    Using the work code *PBZM* will direct Eqtl to detect these files and
    processes their results. It will open a qtlcart.z3e file and determine
    an experimentwise threshold based on the size specified with the -a
    option.

    If the qtlcart.z3a file exists, then Eqtl opens it and computes the
    means and standard deviations, at each test site, of the likelihood
    ratio test statistic, additive effect and dominance effect. The results
    are printed to qtlcart.z3b.

    The jackknife procedure produces a qtlcart.z3i file. Adding a *J* to the
    work code directs Eqtl to computes the means and standard deviations of
    the likelihood ratio test statistic, additive effect and dominance
    effect at each test site. The results are printed to qtlcart.z3j.

REFERENCES
BUGS
    If the resource file indicates that there are more than one trait, then
    Eqtl will try to estimate positions and additive effects for all the
    traits. This will happen even if no analysis was done on the extra
    traits. The output file will then have some null estimates.

    When doing a jackknife with Zmapqtl, the user should check that the file
    ending in the letter i is truely the last version of the interim
    jackknife file. Zmapqtl switches between a file ending in i and another
    ending in j, so check both and move the j file onto the i file if
    required.

    If you set the significance threshold too high, then Eqtl may find no
    QTL in the qtlcart.z output. If this is the case, then Eqtl will crash.
