NAME
    Ttransform.pl - Shell of a script to allow programming of trait
    transformations

SYNOPSIS
      Ttransform.pl [-a a] [-b b] [-c c] [-f func] [-h]   < input > output

DESCRIPTION
    Ttransform.pl reads an Rcross.out formatted file from the standard input
    and writes same to the standard output. You can customize the script to
    transform trait values.

OPTIONS
    You will need to customize the script to suit your needs. Look for the
    phrase LOOK HERE in the script.

    -a  requires a real-valued operand. It is 0.0 by default and used as
        explained below.

    -b  requires a real-valued operand. It is 1.0 by default and used as
        explained below.

    -c  requires a real-valued operand. It is 0.0 by default and used as
        explained below.

    -f  requires an integer-valued operand. It is 1 by default tells
        Ttransform.pl which function to use.

    -h  requires no operand. If used, it prints a usage message and exits.

TRANSFORMS
    There are some predefined transforms available. Let Y be the trait
    value, a, b and c real-valued coefficients and Z the transformed trait.
    Use the -f option and an integer from one to six to have the following
    transforms applied to all traits:

    1   Subtract the mean and divide by the standard error. This is the
        default.

        Z = (Y - Mean(Y)) / STDERR(Y)

    2   Subtract the mean, square it and divide by the sample variance.

        Z = (Y - Mean(Y))^2 / VAR(Y)

    3   This is a linear or quadratic tranform.

        Z = a + b Y + c Y^2

    4   This is a natural log tranform.

        Z = a + b log(Y)

    5   This is an expontial transform

        Z = a exp(b Y)

    6   This is for you to code any transform that you like.

EXAMPLE
    Suppose the file mletest.cro is in the current working directory.

        % Ttransform.pl < mletest.cro > mletest.cro.out

    would transform all the traits in mletest.cro. The default transform is
    to subtract the mean and divide by the standard error.

CAVEATS
    You should know some Perl to use this script.
