#---------->  Documentation for this file

1.  First line:  it is critical that the first line 
start with a pound symbol, a space, a number,   a -filetype token,
and the cross.inp filetype:

# 123456789    -filetype   cross.inp
 ^          ^            ^             
space      space       space        

The spaces are necessary, because the input is token based. 
The program will read the second token in the file as a long integer
and use it as an identifier for the file.   Thus, each file should
have a unique identifier  following the pound symbol.

The '-filetype cross.inp' tells the QTL Cartographer programs that this
is a 'cross.inp' formatted file.  



2. Tokens:   A token is any string of non-whitespace
surrounded by whitespace.  Each time a token begins with a -, it is
assumed to be a command and the token following it is processed.  
The program will ignore any token that it doesn't
recognize.  The tokens that are recognized as commands in a 'cross.inp' file are

-traits
-SampleSize
-TranslationTable
-end
-Cross
-case
-skip
-unskip
-quit
-start

Note that only the first letter of these tokens is actually necessary (except for -start,
-stop and -skip, which require more letters to distinguish between them). 

Case is important.  -Units is different from -units.  

Extra whitespace is ignored, so you can put in spaces, tabs, carriage
returns, etc, to format your data in an understandable fashion.

3.  Meanings of commands:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Token             Followed by           Means
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-Cross            string            type of cross: See below                                  
-traits           integer           number of traits
-otraits          integer           number of categorical variables
-SampleSize       integer           sample size
-case             yes or no         whether comparisons are case sensitive
-TranslationTable table             table for marker translation
-skip                               Tells Rcross to skip everything until  an
-unskip                             which is the end of the -skip.  These 
                                    cannot be within a -start to -stop block
-start            sting             Start of a block of markers, traits or otraits
-stop                               End of a block
-end                                End of the file
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 

The -case token changes how strings are matched.    Put a 'yes' here if comparisons are case dependant.
With 'no', all names of individuals, markers and  traits are converted to lower case to 
make comparisons.

4. Marker Translation:  You can define how markers are translated.   Here is the 
default translation table
 
 -TranslationTable
     AA    2    2
     Aa    1    1
     aa    0    0
     A-   12   12
     a-   10   10
     --   -1   -1

 
Note a few things in the above translation table.  There are six
rows and three columns.  There must be a token in all 18 positions of
the table.  The first column is the genotype.  The program assumes that
the 'A' allele is diagnostic for the 'High' (Parental 1) line and the 
'a' allele is diagnostic for the 'Low' (parental 2) line.  A minus sign
'-' means the allele is unkown.  Thus, dominant markers can be encoded.
The middle column is how the output of these genotypes will be encoded
while the right (3rd) column is how you will code the input of this file.
The above TranslationTable maps 2 to 2, 1 to 1, 0 to 0, etc.  Just about
any set of tokens can be used for the third column, but DO NOT change the
first two columns.  If you encoded your P1 homozygotes as BB, heterozygotes
as Bb, etc, your translation table might appear as

 -TranslationTable
     AA    2   BB
     Aa    1   Bb
     aa    0   bb
     A-   12   B-
     a-   10   b-
     --   -1   --
     
Anything in the following data file that is not recognized (doesn't match
something in column 3) will become unkown (-1) in the output.

REMEMBER:  You need all 18 tokens following the -TranslationTable command
and the first two columns can't be altered.  You can only alter the last
column.
  
  
5. Crosses:  You need to define the type of cross.  We assume that there
are initial parental lines P1 (all AA) and P2 (all aa).  An F1 line is
a cross between P1 and P2.   The following crosses are possible
                 
                 Cross                Symbol              Note
                 F1 x P1               B1
                 F1 x P2               B2
                 F1 x F1 selfed        SF2              selfed F lines
                 SFx x SFx             SFx+1
                 F1 x F1 random        RF2              random mating F lines
                 RFx x RFx             RFx+1
                 Selfed Recomb. Inbred Ri1              Recombinant inbred lines
                 Sib Recomb. Inbred    Ri2
                 P1 x SFx              T(B1)SFx         Test crosses
                 P1 x RFx              T(B1)RFx          Test crosses  
 
See the manual for more on the different crosses that QTL Cartographer can analyze. 

6. Data Input:  Data can be input by markers or by individuals.   
  
I. Data by Markers and Traits:

  One way to organize the data is by markers.  For each marker, you
give the genotypes of the individuals.  The order of the individuals
has to be the same for each marker.  Below is an example.  After the
'-start markers', the program expects a repeating sequence of marker
name, then n marker genotypes where n is the sample size.  The marker
names should match those in the Map file.

-start markers
Marker1_1 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 
Marker1_2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
Marker1_3 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1
Marker1_4 1 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1
Marker1_5 2 2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1
Marker2_1 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 1 1
Marker2_2 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
Marker2_3 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2
Marker2_4 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2
-stop markers 

  The traits are encoded in the same fashion. After the '-start traits'
tokens, the program expects a repeating sequence of trait name and then
n values for the sample.   
The order of the individuals has to be the same as in the markers.  Also,
you can specify the token for a missing trait with

-missingtrait .   

In the above, a lone period indicates a missing datum.

-start traits
Trait_1    5.0  5.3  6.2  4.1  5.5  5.8  6.7  6.1   .   6.4
Trait_2   15.0 15.3 16.2 24.1 25.5 25.8 16.7 26.1 33.2 16.4
-stop traits ... indicates the end of the trait data.

  Categorical (otraits) are other traits that will be stored as character strings.
These will be things such as sex, brood, eye color, etc.  Each token
should be less than 64 characters in length.  The -missingtrait token can be
reused with a different token if desired.  

-start otraits
Sex   M F M M M F F M F F 
Brood 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2
-stop otraits



II. Data by individuals  If the -start and -stop tokens are followed by
the work 'individuals', then data will be read in by individuals.

  Another way to organize the data is by individuals.  The program
expects that the markers are ordered from marker 1 on chromosome 1,
marker 2 on chromosome 1, ...,  to the last marker on the last chromosome.
Since the individuals are named, they can be in any order.

-start individuals markers
Ind_1  2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 2
Ind_2  2 2 2 1 2 1 2 2 1
Ind_3  2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 1 
Ind_4  2 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 1
Ind_5  2 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 1
Ind_6  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
Ind_7  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1
Ind_8  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 1
Ind_9  1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2
Ind_10 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2
-stop individuals markers

  The traits are done similarly.  All the traits have to be in this
block.  Each column is for a different trait.  After the '-start'
token, put individuals followed by traits, then the number of traits
(2), then the names of the traits, then indicate whether the 
individuals are named.  Here they are, but if they weren't, put
an 'notnamed' token where the 'named' token presently is.  'otraits'
below are done in the same fashion.
                         
-start individuals traits 2 Trait_1 Trait_2 named
Ind_1  5.0 15.0
Ind_2  5.3 15.3
Ind_3  6.2 16.2 
Ind_4  4.1 24.1
Ind_5  5.5 25.5
Ind_6  5.8 25.8
Ind_7  6.7 16.7
Ind_8  6.1 26.1
Ind_9   .  33.2
Ind_10 6.4 16.4
-stop individuals traits     

-start individuals otraits 2 sex brood named
Ind_1   M 1 
Ind_2   F 1
Ind_3   M 1 
Ind_4   M 1 
Ind_5   M 1 
Ind_6   F 2
Ind_7   F 2 
Ind_8   M 2
Ind_9   F 2
Ind_10  F 2 
-stop  individuals otraits

7.  Termination:   The -end token will tell Rcross to stop reading the file and
to the translation.  The token -quit will do the same thing.


8.  Annotation:   You can annotate the input file as much as you want. Be careful to 
not put annotation in the -start to -stop or -interactions to -stop blocks.
Also, don't use words that begin with a minus sign, or put such words in a 
-skip to -unskip block.  Finally, anything after an -end or -quit token will be
ignored. 
 

9. Usage:  If this file were called 'cross.inp', then 

% Rcross -i cross.inp

would convert this file to the format required for the other programs
in the QTL Cartographer system.  The above assumes that an appropriate map
file exists.
