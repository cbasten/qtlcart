NAME
    Qstats - Calculate basic statistics for a QTL dataset.

SYNOPSIS
    Qstats [ -o *output* ] [ -i *input* ] [ -m *mapfile* ] [ -p *yes* ]

DESCRIPTION
    Qstats does some basic statistics on a dataset of quantitative traits.
    It plots a histogram and calculates the sample size, mean, variance
    standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and average deviation for a
    quantitative trait. The program also summarizes missing marker and trait
    data, as will as determining the marker types (dominant or codominant).
    Finally, Qstats will test whether markers are segregating at random. It
    requires a molecular map that could be a random one produced by Rmap, or
    a real one in the same format as the output of Rmap. The sample could be
    a randomly generated one from Rcross or a real one in the same format as
    the output of Rcross.

OPTIONS
    See QTLcart(1) for more information on the global options -h for help,
    -A for automatic, -V for non-Verbose -W path for a working directory, -R
    file to specify a resource file, -e to specify the log file, -s to
    specify a seed for the random number generator and -X stem to specify a
    filename stem. The options below are specific to this program.

    If you use this program without specifying any options, then you will
    get into a menu that allows you to set them interactively.

    -o  This requires a filename for output. Qstats will append the file if
        it exists, and create a new file if it does not. If not used, then
        Qstats will use qtlcart.qst.

    -i  This requires an input filename. This file must exist. It should be
        in the same format as the output of Rcross. The default file is
        qtlcart.cro.

    -m  Qstats requires a genetic linkage map. This option require the name
        of a file containing the map. It should be in the same format that
        Rmap outputs. The default file is qtlcart.map.

    -p  requires an argument *yes* or *no*. By default it is *no*. If used
        with *yes*, then the probability distribution for each marker and
        each individual will be written in a section at the end of the
        output file.

INPUT FORMAT
    The input format of the molecular map should be the same as that of the
    output format from the program Rmap. The input format of the individual
    data should be the same as the output format of the program Rcross.

OUTPUT
    As mentioned above, the output will have sections for basic statistics
    on the traits, missing data summaries and segregation statistics. If the
    -p option is used with an argument *yes*, then marker distributions are
    printed in a section at the end. For each marker, there will be a table
    that has individuals as rows and the probability distribution and
    expected values of the marker as columns. An example of the output is

        -begin markerprobs
        -markername BD267                 -chromosome     1 -marker     1
        -h   ind.   p(QQ)   p(Qq)    p(qq)   E(a)     E(d)
                1  0.3304  0.5242  0.1454   0.1851   0.0242
                2  0.3441  0.4850  0.1709   0.1731  -0.0150
                3  0.3747  0.4958  0.1295   0.2452  -0.0042
                4  0.0696  0.3884  0.5421  -0.4725  -0.1116
                5  0.2597  0.5696  0.1707   0.0889   0.0696
                6  0.2903  0.5500  0.1598   0.1305   0.0500
                7  0.2903  0.5500  0.1598   0.1305   0.0500
                8  0       0       1       -1.0     -0.5

    The section begins with *-begin markerprobs* and ends with *-end
    markerprobs*. Each marker is then listed and a header line is followed
    by the output. The first column is the individual number. The next three
    are the probabilities of QQ, Qq and qq genotypes, respectively. Then,
    the expected values for additive and dominance effects are calculated
    via

        E(a) = p(QQ) - p(qq)
        E(d) = [p(Qq)-p(QQ)-p(qq)]/2

    One could use the final two values as replacements for the marker values
    in a regression analysis. The additive expectation is calculated
    assuming that QQ genotypes have value 1, while Qq and qq genotypes have
    values 0 and -1, respectively. The dominance expectation sets
    heterozygotes equal to 1/2 and homozygotes to -1/2.

    This option produces a lot of output: It is off by default. The
    probabilities follow from Jiang and Zeng (1997).

    Note that the line for individual 8 has p(QQ) = p(Qq) = 0, while p(qq) =
    1. This is a dominant marker and individual 8 had the unambiguous
    genotype qq. You would see similar output for codominant markers.

EXAMPLES
        % Qstats -i corn.cro -m corn.map 

    Calculates basic statistics on the dataset in corn.cro using the genetic
    linkage map in corn.map. The program will display and interactive menu
    for setting options and print out messages to the screen while running.
    These can be turned off with -A and -V, respectively. If the dataset in
    corn.cro has more than one trait, then all traits will be analyzed.
