NAME
    Model8.pl - Iterate Zmapqtl model 8 to determine a stable set of
    cofactors

SYNOPSIS
      Model8.pl  [-b bindir] [-X stem] [-S sig. threshold] [-i iterations] 
        [-m max nbp] [-H hypothesis] [-h]   

DESCRIPTION
    Model8.pl iterates using Zmapqtl and Eqtl to determine a stable set of
    cofactors for composite interval mapping. First, interval mapping is run
    and the nearest markers to significant peaks are identified. These
    markers are used as cofactors in the first iteration of composite
    interval mapping. A new set of cofactors are identified by proximity to
    the likelihood peaks and the process is repeated.

OPTIONS
    -b  This option requires the path to the QTL Cartographer binaries and
        perl scripts.

    -i  requires an integer to control how many iterations you want to do.

    -X  This option allows you to specify the filename stem.

    -S  This option requires a real number to indicate the significance
        threshold for the likelihood ratio.

    -m  This option allows you to specify the maximum number of background
        parameters in composite interval mapping.

    -H  Use this option to specify which hypothesis test you want to use.
        The usual values are 10 or 30.

    -h  requires no operand. If used, it prints a usage message and exits.

EXAMPLE
    Suppose the files mletest.map and mletest.cro are in the current working
    directory.

        % Model8.pl  -b /home/basten/bin  -X mletest -S 13.0 -m 25 -H 10 -i 15

    Will assume that the QTL Cartographer programs are in /home/basten/bin.
    It will use a significance threshold of 13.0 and allow for up to 25
    markers in composite interval mapping. It will iterate 15 times in an
    attempt to find a stable set of cofactors. This script uses another
    script called SRcompare.pl which compares the set of cofactors (in
    SRmapqtl.out format) between consecutive runs and reports how many
    cofactors have been added or deleted.
