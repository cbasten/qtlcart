NAME
    Rcross - Simulate or reformat a data set.

SYNOPSIS
    Rcross [ -o *output* ] [ -i *input* ] [ -m *mapfile* ] [ -q *modelfile*
    ] [ -g *Output* ] [ -r *repetitions* ] [ -c *Cross* ] [ -n *SampleSize*
    ] [ -H *heredity* ] [ -E *Ve* ] [ -I *Interactive* ]

DESCRIPTION
    Rcross performs a random cross or reformats a data set. Cross types
    include F1 backcrosses to the P1 or P2, F2 crosses produced by selfing
    or random mating, recombinant inbred lines as well as a few others. It
    simulates marker and trait data. The markers simulated come from a
    molecular map that could be a random one produced by Rmap, or a real one
    in the same format as the output of Rmap. The QTL model could be a
    random set produced by Rqtl or an estimated set in the same format as
    the output of Rqtl.

    Rcross can also translate files from three different formats. If the
    user chooses to translate a file, then the simulation options are
    ignored.

OPTIONS
    See QTLcart(1) for more information on the global options -h for help,
    -A for automatic, -V for non-Verbose -W path for a working directory, -R
    file to specify a resource file, -e to specify the log file, -s to
    specify a seed for the random number generator and -X stem to specify a
    filename stem. The options below are specific to this program.

    If you use this program without specifying any options, then you will
    get into a menu that allows you to set them interactively.

    -o  This requires a filename for output. Rcross will overwrite the file
        if it exists, and create a new file if it does not. If not used,
        then Rcross will use qtlcart.cro. This output is in a format
        suitable for any of the mapping programs.

    -i  This requires an input filename. This file must exist. Rcross will
        attempt to identify the format of the file and translate it to
        another format. Specifying a file with this option turns off the
        simulation parameters below.

    -m  Rcross requires a genetic linkage map. This option require the name
        of a file containing the map. It should be in the same format that
        Rmap outputs. The default file is qtlcart.map.

    -q  Rcross needs a genetic model to simulate a data set. It will read
        from the file specified by this option. The file specified should
        contain a genetic model in the same format as the output of Rqtl.
        The default file is qtlcart.qtl.

    -H  Allows the user to specify the heritability for the trait. If used,
        it requires a value in the range 0.0 to 1.0. It is 0.5 by default.

    -E  Allows the user to specify an environmental variance for the trait.
        If used, it requires a positive value and will disable the
        heritability. This is ignored by default.

    -I  is the flag to turn on interactive crosses. By default, it has a
        value of 0. To do interactive crosses, use this option with the
        value 1.

    -c  Allows the user to specify the type of cross. It requires a string
        such as B1, SF2 or RI1. See below for more on the values of the
        cross.

    -g  This should be used with an integer in the range 0 to 6. It
        specifies the format of the output. The default is 0 and the other
        options are defined below.

    -n  This is the sample size of the offspring. It is 200 by default and
        requires some integer value greater than 0 if used.

INPUT FORMAT
    The input format of the molecular map should be the same as that of the
    output format from the program Rmap. The input form of the QTL data
    should be that of the output format from Rqtl. If an input file for the
    data is used, then it can have one of two formats. The first is
    identical to the raw files required by MAPMAKER. You must first use
    MAPMAKER to create a genetic map, then run the map through Rmap to
    reformat it, then use the map and the original raw file to reformat the
    data for subsequent use.

    An alternative format is defined in a file cross.inp that is included
    with the distribution. The file can be annotated freely. Look at the
    cross.inp file and use it as a template for your data. In addition, you
    can use the qtlcart.mcd files that were formatted for the Windows
    version of QTL Cartographer.

    Rcross can read the input files formatted for use with PLABQTL. You will
    need to add the phrase *-filetype plabqtl0.inp* (matrix format) or
    *-filetype plabqtl1.inp* (vector format) to the first line of the
    PLABQTL formatted input file. Also, be sure that there are no map files
    in the current working directory: You want Rcross to read the map that
    is in the PLABQTL input file. If your PLABQTL input file has
    measurements for your traits in different environments, you need to add
    the phrase *-environments x* at the end of the first line, where *x* is
    the number of environments. If you have *t* traits, then Rcross will
    output *(x+1)t* traits. Generally, the main block of data will have the
    means of each trait over environments while the raw data are appended to
    the end of the PLABQTL file. The raw measurements will be named
    *TrYEnvX* in the output, where *Y* and *X* are the trait and environment
    numbers. For example, if weight (trait 1) and height (trait 2) are the
    two traits and they are measured in three environments, then there will
    be eight traits in the output file. The raw data for weight will be
    named *Tr1Env1*, *Tr1Env2* and *Tr1Env3*, while for height they will be
    *Tr2Env1*, *Tr2Env2* and *Tr2Env3*.

OUTPUT
    Rcross can produce eight different types of output files. The output
    formats are specified by an integer from 0 to 7 used with the *-g*
    command line option or set in the text menu. The numbers correspond to
    the following output formats:

    Value 0.
        *qtlcart.cro*: This is the default and standard format for the
        analysis programs in the QTL Cartographer package.

    Value 1.
        *cross.inp*: This is a standard input format designed for Rcross.
        The manual has more details.

    Value 2.
        *mapmaker.raw*: This is the MAPMAKER raw file format.

    Value 3.
        *qtlcart.r*: This format is suitable for import into the programs R
        or Splus. All the data will be written into the file and embedded in
        commands that allow R/Splus to read it. In addition, Rcross writes a
        set of commands to do ANOVA analyses of each trait on each marker
        and categorical trait. For a file named *qtlcart.r*, use the command
        source("qtlcart.r") in R/Splus to import the data. Note that names
        of traits, markers and categorical traits must conform to R/Splus
        usage.

    Value 4.
        *qtlcart.sas*: This format is a SAS program that has all the data
        and a set of PROC GLM commands to do ANOVA and Means analyses
        similiar to the R/Splus option above. Note that names of traits,
        markers and categorical traits must conform to SAS usage. Thanks to
        Emilio Carbonell for the suggestion.

    Value 5.
        *plabqtl0.qdt*: This will produce a file suitable for input into
        PLABQTL. The data will be in the matrix format. See the PLABQTL
        manual for more details.

    Value 6.
        *plabqtl1.qdt*: This will produce a file suitable for input into
        PLABQTL. The data will be in the vector format. See the PLABQTL
        manual for more details.

    Value 7.
        *qtlcart.mcd*: This will produce a file suitable for input into the
        Windows GUI version of QTL Cartographer (Wang, *et al.,* 2002). This
        is a single file with the genetic linkage map and the data set. The
        format is similar to the map.inp and cross.inp formats.

CROSSES
    A pair of inbred parental lines (P1 and P2) that differ in the trait of
    interest and marker genotypes are crossed to produce an F1 generation.
    All crosses are then derived from these lines. Backcrossing to P1 is
    encoded by B1, and to P2 by B2. Selfed intercrosses of generation i are
    encoded by SFi. Randomly mated intercrosses of generation i are encoded
    by RFi. Recombinant inbreds created by selfing have the code RI1, while
    those by sib-mating are RI2. Doubled haploids have the code RI0. A test
    cross of an SFi line to a Pj line is encoded by T(Bj)SFi. The QTL
    Cartographer manual explains some other crosses that are possible. Note
    that the UNIX shell may interpret ( and ) so they should either be
    quoted, or the cross entered into the interactive menu.

    Rcross uses the general genetic model developed by Cockerham (1954).

EXAMPLES
            % Rcross  -A -V -c SF2 -n 1000

    Does a selfed F2 cross with 1000 offspring using the linkage map in
    qtlcart.map and the model in qtlcart.qtl. The command line options -A
    and -V turn off the interactive menu and the verbosity mode,
    respectively.

            % Rcross  -i cross.raw 

    Reads from the file cross.raw, tries to determine its format, and
    translates it if possible. The file cross.raw could be a MAPMAKER/QTL
    formatted file, a cross.inp formatted file or one that is already in the
    Rcross.out format.

BUGS
    If you use the interactive mode, you can print out the results of
    crosses. The analysis of these arbitrary crosses has not been fully
    integrated into the other programs.

    The input subroutines for importing PLABQTL files has not been
    extensively tested. Check your output for correctness.

    The Windows version of QTL Cartographer (Wang, *et al.,* 2002) requires
    files with DOS line endings. Either do the conversions on a Windows
    machine, or ftp the files to the Windows machine as text.
