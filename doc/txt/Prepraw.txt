NAME
    Prepraw.pl - Input a mapmaker.raw file and prepare it for QTL
    Cartographer

SYNOPSIS
       Prepraw [-h]  < input  > output

DESCRIPTION
    Prepraw.pl reads from the standard input and writes to the standard
    output. It reads a mapmaker.raw file and reformats it slightly. It will
    use standard tokens for each marker type. It will count the number of
    individuals typed for each marker, and print a warning if there are
    missing tokens.

OPTIONS
    -h  requires no operand. If used, it prints a usage message and exits.

EXAMPLE
    Suppose you have a MAPMAKER raw file called corn.raw. If you have
    trouble converting it with Rcross, then try this.

            % Prepraw.pl < corn.raw > corn2.raw

    and check if there are the proper number of data points for each marker
    and trait.

SEE ALSO
