NAME
    Bootstrap.pl - Do a bootstrap analysis with Zmapqtl

SYNOPSIS
      Bootstrap.pl [-b bin] [ -X stem] [-m model] [-r iterations] [-e email] 
           [-H hypothesis] [-a rep] [-s] [-h]   

DESCRIPTION
    Bootstrap.pl iterates using Prune and Zmapqtl to determine sampling
    variances based on a bootstrap resampling.

OPTIONS
    If the qtlcart.rc file if it exists, Bootstrap.pl will first set its
    parameter values from that file. Any command line options will override
    the qtlcart.rc values. If a parameter has not been set by either the
    qtlcart.rc file or command line parameters, default values are set.

    -b  This option requires the path to the QTL Cartographer binaries and
        perl scripts.

    -r  requires an integer to control how many bootstrap iterations you
        want to do. The default is 1000.

    -X  This option allows you to specify the filename stem. The default is
        *qtlcart*.

    -e  This option requires an email address. The temporary log file will
        be sent to this address to indicate that the bootstrap is complete.
        If blank, then no email message will be sent. The default is not to
        use this option.

    -m  This option allows you to specify the Zmapqtl model to use. The
        default is interval mapping (3).

    -H  Use this option to specify which hypothesis test you want to use.
        The usual values are 1 or 30. The default is 1: Unless there are
        three genotypic classes, do not change this option..

    -s  requires no operand. This tells Bootstrap.pl to save the
        bootstrapped datasets and their analytical results. If used with a
        large number of bootstraps, a great deal of harddisk space will be
        used up. It is mainly for debugging purposes.

    -a  requires an integer operand indicating the last completed iteration.
        Useful if your machine crashed during the bootstrap.

    -h  requires no operand. If used, it prints a usage message and exits.

EXAMPLE
    Suppose the files mletest.map and mletest.cro are in the current working
    directory.

        % Zmapqtl -X mletest -M 3 -A -V 
        % Bootstrap.pl  -b /home/basten/bin  -r 500

    These commands assume that the QTL Cartographer programs are in
    /home/basten/bin. It will use interval mapping and do 500 bootstrap
    iterations. Note that you need to do an initial Zmapqtl run before
    beginning the bootstrap, and that initial run will set the filename stem
    and the model for analysis.

    If your machine crashed during the bootstrap analysis, then you can
    restart where you left off (provided that the crash occurred during the
    Zmapqtl run). Suppose the above completed 356 iterations and crashed
    during iteration 357. Then

        % Bootstrap.pl  -b /home/basten/bin  -r 500 -a 356

    would pick up the bootstrap at iteration 357 and complete at 500.

CAVEATS
    The -s option allows you to save the bootstrapped datasets and
    analytical results. For iteration *i*, model *m*, filename stem
    *qtlcart* and single trait analysis, there will be files qtlcart.cro.i,
    qtlcart.zm.i and qtlcart.zm.bi.

    This option is mainly for debugging purposes. Be aware that a large
    number of iterations will use a great deal of disk space. You could
    modify the Bootstrap.pl script to compress these files to save disk
    space.
