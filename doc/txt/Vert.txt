NAME
    Vert.pl - Convert line endings

SYNOPSIS
       Vert.pl [-i u||d||m ] [-o u||d||m  ]  [-h] < input > output

DESCRIPTION
    Vert.pl reads from the standard input and writes to the standard output.
    It converts the line endings of text files from one format to another
    based on the optins -i and -o. The default is to convert UNIX files into
    DOS files.

OPTIONS
    -i  This option requires a one letter code indicating the type of input
        file. Options are u for UNIX, d for DOS and m for Macintosh.

    -o  This option requires a one letter code indicating the type of output
        file. Options are u for UNIX, d for DOS and m for Macintosh.

    -h  requires no operand. If used, it prints a usage message and exits.

EXAMPLE
    Suppose corn.cro and corn.map are UNIX formatted files that you want to
    convert to DOS. The following sequence converts them to DOS format

            % Vert.pl -i u -o d < corn.cro > dcorn.cro
            % Vert.pl -i u -o d < corn.map > dcorn.map
        
    No imagine that you have an entire directory of UNIX files and you want
    to convert them to Macintosh formatted files. You could use

            % foreach i ( * )
            ? Vert.pl -i u -o m < $i > $i.mac
            ? /usr/bin/mv $i.mac $i
            ? end
            %

    The above would replace all of the files with Macintosh formatted
    versions. Alternatively, you could copy them into a new directory:

            % mkdir macdir
            % foreach i ( * )
            ? if ( -f $i ) Vert.pl -i u -o m < $i > macdir/$i 
            ? end
            %

    This script is useful for shared filesystems, that is when a fileserver
    can be accessed by Windows, UNIX or Macintoshes.
