NAME
    Ztrim.pl - Trim a Zmapqtl output file for terminal reading

SYNOPSIS
       Ztrim.pl  [-H Hypothesis]  [-l lines]  [-w width] [-t]  [-r]  
               [-s]  [-h] < input > output

DESCRIPTION
    Ztrim.pl reads from the standard input and writes to the standard
    output. It reads the output of Zmapqtl and eliminates columns based on
    the value of *Hypothesis*. It is a quick way to make the output file fit
    in a terminal window without having the text wrap.

OPTIONS
    -H  This option requires an integer value of 1, 10, 20, 30,31, 32 or 33.
        The behavior of the program for each value is explained below.

    -l  This option requires an integer value greater than 1. It specifies
        how often the column headers should be printed. The default value of
        0 means that headers will be printed at the top of each block of
        output. If your terminal shows 25 lines, then it is useful to
        reprint the header every 21 lines so as to have a header on each
        page of the output. (The header is 3 lines long...if you use more,
        then you will need one more line for it.)

    -w  This option requires an integer value greater than 1. It specifies
        character width of the output terminal. The default is 80, which is
        a common value. It only effects the horizontal bars defining the
        headers.

    -h  requires no operand. If used, it prints a usage message and exits.

    -r  Prints R squared values

    -t  Prints total R squared values

    -s  Prints residual test statistic values

OUTPUT
    Different values used with the *-H* option allow the user to output
    specific columns from the *qtlcart.z* file. All options print out
    columns for the chromosome, marker and postions. All print at least one
    likelihood ratio test statistic and at least one parameter estimate.

    For crosses with two marker classes (backcrosses and recombinant
    inbreds), we can estimate one parameter value, namely the additive
    effect. The test is H0 (no QTL) versus H1 (QTL with an additive effect
    *a*).

    For crosses with three marker classes, we can estimate additive and
    dominance effects. Let *a* be the additive effect and *d* be the
    dominance effect. We can set up four hypotheses:

    H0  No QTL: *a* = 0 and *d* = 0.

    H1  QTL with an additive effect: *a* not 0 and *d* = 0. We refer to the
        estimate of the additive effect as *a1* under this hypothesis.

    H2  QTL with a dominance effect: *a* = 0 and *d* not 0. We refer to the
        estimate of the dominance effect as *d2* under this hypothesis.

    H3  QTL with both an additive and a dominance effect: *a* not 0 and *d*
        not 0. We refer to the estimate of the additive effect as *a3* and
        that of the dominance effect as *d3* under this hypothesis.

    Using the following values with the *-H* option yields

    1   This is the default and is useful for crosses with two genotypic
        classes. The output simply deletes the columns with zeros. You are
        left with the likelihood ratio of H1 to H0 and the estimate of the
        additive effect.

    10  This essentially prints the same information as 1 above except it
        does it for crosses with three genotypic classes.

    20  This prints the likelihood ratio for a test of dominance where the
        additive effect is zero. You get the H2 to H0 likelihood ratio, the
        estimate of dominance, the R squared estimates and the test
        statistic for normality of the residuals.

    30  This prints the H3 to H0 likelihood ratio. You get the hypothesis
        test likelihood ratio, the estimates of additivity and dominance,
        the R squared estimates and the test statistic for normality of the
        residuals.

    31  This option prints everything that option 30 prints, but adds the
        test of H3 to H1 and the *a1* estimate.

    32  This option prints everything that option 30 prints, but adds the
        test of H3 to H2 and the *d2* estimate.

EXAMPLE
      ./Ztrim.pl -l 20 -w 78 -H 30 -s < qtlcart.z | more

    will print the test statistic H3:H0 and the estimates of the additive
    and dominance effects for the results in *qtlcart.z*. It will also
    reprint the column headers every 20 lines. This works well for a
    terminal set to 24 lines by 80 columns. The headers take 3 lines each
    and the more command chews up the last line of each screen.
