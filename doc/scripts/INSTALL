    Install instructions for the perl and csh scripts.

    To install the c-shell scripts and perl scripts, first edit the
    Makefile and change to suit your needs.   The line 

BINDIR =  /Users/basten/bin

should be changed so that the scripts go into the same directory as your
QTL Cart binaries.   The lines

REMOVE = /bin/rm -f
INSTALL = /bin/cp
MOVE = /bin/mv -f
PERL = /usr/bin/perl
CSH = /bin/csh
 
should be changed to reflect the true locations of rm, cp, mv, perl and
csh.   You could try using tcsh in place of csh if you like.

Next, look at the file scripts.cfg and modify the lines with
TheBinDir and EmailAddress to set them to appropriate values.   


Once the Makefile has been edited, type

make  

to install the scripts.   This step will change the first line of the
scripts to use the perl and csh commands defined in the Makefile.


Sometimes, you will get a message back from the make command like this:

make: Nothing to be done for `all'.


If so, then you will need to 'touch' the files and remake.  

make touch
make

should do the trick.
