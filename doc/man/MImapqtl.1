[ \fB\-p\fR \fIphase\fR ] 
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBMImapqtl\fR uses multiple interval mapping to map quantitative trait loci to
a map of molecular markers.  It requires a molecular map that could be a 
random one produced by 
\&\fBRmap\fR,  or a real one in the same format as the output of 
\&\fBRmap\fR.   The sample could be a randomly generated one from 
\&\fBRcross\fR or a real one in the same format as the output of 
\&\fBRcross\fR. In addition, the program can use an initial genetic model.
This model will most likely be produced by running \fBEqtl\fR on the results
of a \fBZmapqtl\fR run, but could be the results of a prior run of \fBMImapqtl\fR.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
See \fB\f(BIQTLcart\fB\|(1)\fR for more information on the global options
\&\fB\-h\fR for help, \fB\-A\fR for automatic,  \fB\-V\fR for non-Verbose
\&\fB\-W path\fR for a working directory, \fB\-R file\fR to specify a resource
file, \fB\-e\fR to specify the log file, \fB\-s\fR to specify a seed for the
random number generator and \fB\-X stem\fR to specify a filename stem. 
The options below are specific to this program.
.PP
If you use this program without specifying any options, then you will
get into a menu that allows you to set them interactively.   
.IP "\fB\-o\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o"
This requires a filename for output.   \fBMImapqtl\fR will append the file
if it exists, and create a new file if it does not.   If not used, then
\&\fBMImapqtl\fR will use \fIqtlcart.mim\fR.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i"
This requires an input filename.    This file must exist.  It should be in the
same format as the output of \fBRcross\fR. The default file is \fIqtlcart.cro\fR. 
.IP "\fB\-m\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m"
\&\fBMImapqtl\fR requires a genetic linkage map.  This option requires
the name of a file containing the map.  It should be in the same format
that \fBRmap\fR outputs.  The default file is \fIqtlcart.map\fR. 
.IP "\fB\-t\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t"
Use this to specify which trait \fBMImapqtl\fR will analyze.  If this
number is greater than the number of traits, then all traits will be
analyzed unless the trait name begins with a minus sign. If a negative
number is given, then only traits beginning with a plus sign will be
analyzed.   The default is to analyze trait 1 only.
.IP "\fB\-E\fR" 4
.IX Item "-E"
Allows the user to specify the name of the file containing the genetic model for input.
This file should be in the   format of \fIRqtl.out\fR and produced by \fBRqtl\fR, \fBEqtl\fR or
\&\fBMImapqtl\fR.   A new model will be placed in the file specified with the \fB\-O\fR option.
For an initial analysis (phase 0), this will default to \fIqtlcarti.mqt\fR.
.IP "\fB\-O\fR" 4
.IX Item "-O"
Allows the user to specify the name of the file containing the genetic model for output.
For an initial analysis (phase 0), this will default to \fIqtlcarto.mqt\fR.
.IP "\fB\-q\fR" 4
.IX Item "-q"
\&\fBMImapqtl\fR has a limit to the number of \s-1QTL\s0 it can analyze.  For 32 bit machines,
this is 19 \s-1QTL\s0.  For 64 bit machines, this can be 31.  If you set this to a number
higher than that allowed, it will be reset to the maximum allowed for the machine type.
.IP "\fB\-k\fR" 4
.IX Item "-k"
The user can specify the maximum number of epistatic terms allowed in the model.
.IP "\fB\-d\fR" 4
.IX Item "-d"
\&\fBMImapqtl\fR walks along an interval at this rate during the refinement of \s-1QTL\s0 positions
and the search for more \s-1QTL\s0.
.IP "\fB\-S\fR" 4
.IX Item "-S"
Requires an integer value to indicate the information criterion for declaring the
presence or absence of a parameter.   Information criteria
are explained below.
.IP "\fB\-L\fR" 4
.IX Item "-L"
Requires a real value to indicate the threshold for adding or deleting parameters to
a model.   Comparisons are made based on the information criterion function specified with
the \fB\-S\fR option above.  The default is 
3.84.  If this is set too low, the program will continue to find \s-1QTL\s0 until it
hits the upper limit.   If set too high, it will not find any \s-1QTL\s0.     
.IP "\fB\-I\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I"
Requires an eight character string that codes for what the program should do.  See below
for more explanation.
.IP "\fB\-p\fR" 4
.IX Item "-p"
is used with an integer to specify the \fIphase\fR of the analysis.  See below for more explanation.
.SH "FILES"
.IX Header "FILES"
You will need a map of molecular markers, \fIqtlcart.map\fR and a data set, \fIqtlcart.cro\fR.
You can also specify an initial genetic model, \fIqtlcart.qtl\fR.  
.PP
The input format of the molecular map should be the same as that of the output 
format from the program 
\&\fBRmap\fR.   The input format of the individual data should be the same as the output format
of the program  \fBRcross\fR.  If you use an initial genetic model, it should be of the
same format as an \fBRqtl\fR output file.   The output of \fBEqtl\fR will also have such a model,
as will the output of \fBMImapqtl\fR itself.   
.PP
\&\fBMImapqtl\fR can produce three types of output files.  Most results will be put in the
\&\fIqtlcart.mim\fR file, while the \fBRqtl\fR formatted output file will be \fIqtlcart.mqt\fR.  
If you choose to calculate residuals, they will be placed in \fIqtlcart.res\fR, which will
have the same format as an \fBRcross\fR output file.
.SH "NOTES"
.IX Header "NOTES"
.Sh "\s-1ANALYSIS\s0"
.IX Subsection "ANALYSIS"
If \fBMImapqtl\fR is invoked and an initial model is provided, it will do the following 
seven steps:
.IP "\fBStep 1.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Step 1."
Initial Model
.Sp
Read in the initial model and convert it to a usable format.  The model is read from
the file specified by the \fB\-E\fR option and must exist.   
.IP "\fBStep 2.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Step 2."
Parameter Estimation
.Sp
Estimate all parameters in the initial model.   If used, then the initial model simply 
specifies the positions of the \s-1QTL\s0.
.IP "\fBStep 3.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Step 3."
Refine Positions
.Sp
Refine the estimates of the positions of all \s-1QTL\s0 in the initial model.  This refinement occurs
in the interval where the \s-1QTL\s0 resides.  This is not an option to search other intervals for
\&\s-1QTL\s0.
.IP "\fBStep 4.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Step 4."
Test parameters
.Sp
Test each parameter in the initial model for significance.  This follows
a backward elimination procedure, and those parameters that do not lead to a significant
improvement in fit are dropped.   The threshold for dropping parameters 
is specified by the \fB\-L\fR option.  The information criterion is calculated for the model
with and without the tested parameter, and the difference must be greater than the threshold
for the effect to be retained.
.IP "\fBStep 5.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Step 5."
Search for \s-1QTL\s0
.Sp
Search for more \s-1QTL\s0.  This follows a forward stepwise procedure, whereby the
genome is scanned, the most likely place for a new \s-1QTL\s0 is determined, and if it results
in a significant improvement, is retained.   
.IP "\fBStep 6.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Step 6."
Epistasis   search
.Sp
Search for epistatic interactions between the \s-1QTL\s0 in the model.  This will
do all pairwise combinations of the \s-1QTL\s0 that survive steps 4 and 5.
.IP "\fBStep 7.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Step 7."
Calculate predictions
.Sp
Calculate breeding values, the Variance-Covariance matrix and R2 values for the parameters.
.PP
If the user specifies that no initial model is to be used, then the analysis starts
with step 5 above.    
.Sh "\s-1WORK\s0 \s-1CODE\s0"
.IX Subsection "WORK CODE"
The \fBWork Code\fR must be specified with an 8 letter string.  Each letter in the string
is a flag to tell the program whether to do a certain step.  Some of the flags have options
to modify the behavior of that step.  The 8 letter string starts from position 0.  The remaining
positions (1\-7) correspond to the steps given in the previous section.  
.IP "\fBPosition 0.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Position 0."
Scan flag
.Sp
This can take on values \fBS\fR or \fBs\fR.   If \fBS\fR, then \fBMImapqtl\fR will go into scan mode.
It will do one pass in the search for \s-1QTL\s0 phase, and print out positions and a likelihood 
profile to the output file.   The user can then plot the values and decide where to place a
new \s-1QTL\s0.   
.IP "\fBPosition 1.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Position 1."
Model flag
.Sp
Tells \fBMImapqtl\fR whether to use the initial model specified  with the \fB\-E\fR option. If
\&\fBM\fR, then use the model, and if \fBm\fR, don't use it.   If you use \fBm\fR, then you should
also specify \fBprt\fR in positions 2, 3 and 4.  For example, \fBsmprtSEC\fR would make sense:
It would search for \s-1QTL\s0 \fIde novo\fR. 
.IP "\fBPosition 2.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Position 2."
Parameter flag
.Sp
Use a \fBP\fR here if you want \fBMImapqtl\fR to re-estimate the paramters in the initial model.
Use a \fBp\fR if you want to skip this step.  The case of this position should almost always 
match that of position  1. 
.IP "\fBPosition 3.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Position 3."
Refine postion flag
.Sp
Use an \fBR\fR here if you want \fBMImapqtl\fR to refine the position estimates in the initial model.
Use an \fBr\fR if you want to skip this step. If you don't have an initial model, then this should
be \fBr\fR.  You can also extend the refinement of position to the immediate adjacent intervals
by using \fBA\fR in this position.   
.IP "\fBPosition 4.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Position 4."
Test flag
.Sp
Use a \fBT\fR here if you want \fBMImapqtl\fR to test the significance of the parameters in the initial model.
Use a \fBt\fR if you want to skip this step.  If you don't have an initial model, then this should
be \fBt\fR.   You can use \fBD\fR in place of \fBT\fR in order to test dominance effects only, but t
his is only relevant
with three marker classes.   Finally, if you want to test any existing epistatic interactions,
then use \fBE\fR.  
.IP "\fBPosition 5.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Position 5."
Search flag
.Sp
Use an \fBS\fR here if you want \fBMImapqtl\fR to search for more \s-1QTL\s0.
Use an \fBs\fR if you want to skip this step.  You can also specify a \fBA\fR if you only want to
search for the additive effects of putative \s-1QTL\s0 (that is, don't search for dominance effects
in Fx lines).  Finally, if you use a \fBD\fR here, \fBMImapqtl\fR will only search for dominance effects
at \s-1QTL\s0 locations that don't already have them.
.IP "\fBPosition 6.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Position 6."
Epistasis flag
.Sp
Use an \fBE\fR here if you want \fBMImapqtl\fR to search for epistatic effects.
Use an \fBe\fR if you want to skip this step.   By default, the \fBMImapqtl\fR does a forward
stepwise search for epistatic terms.   If you want to try a backward elimination approach,
use a \fBB\fR in this position, but be aware that if there are too many epistatic terms,
the request will be ignored in favor of a forward search.   Finally, a \fBU\fR in this postion
will do a backward elimination approach but the limit to the number of parameters will
be the sample size minus one.  
.IP "\fBPosition 7.\fR" 4
.IX Item "Position 7."
Covariance flag
.Sp
Use a \fBC\fR here if you want \fBMImapqtl\fR to calculate the variance-covariance matrix, R2 values and
breeding values for the final model.  
Use a \fBc\fR if you want to skip this step.   If you specify an \fBR\fR in this spot, then 
for the current model, the residuals for the trait being analyzed are calculated and 
used as the new trait values.  These residuals are written to a file \fIstem.res\fR where
\&\fIstem\fR is the filename stem.  
.PP
The default string is \fBsmprtSeC\fR, which tells \fBMImapqtl\fR to scan for \s-1QTL\s0 without an
initial model, where the   the additive and dominance effects are
treated as a unit.   
.Sh "\s-1INFORMATION\s0 \s-1CRITERIA\s0"
.IX Subsection "INFORMATION CRITERIA"
See Kao, Zeng and Basten (1999) for more detailed information on the information 
criteria.   We use 
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        IC(k) = -2(log(L) - k c(n) / 2)
.Ve
.PP
where L is the likelihood for a k\-parameter model and \fIlog\fR is the natural log
function.   The penalty function \fIc(n)\fR
takes one of six forms:
.IP "\fB1.\fR   c(n) = log(n)" 4
.IX Item "1.   c(n) = log(n)"
.PD 0
.IP "\fB2.\fR   c(n) = 2" 4
.IX Item "2.   c(n) = 2"
.IP "\fB3.\fR   c(n) = 2 log(log(n))" 4
.IX Item "3.   c(n) = 2 log(log(n))"
.IP "\fB4.\fR   c(n) = 2 log(n)" 4
.IX Item "4.   c(n) = 2 log(n)"
.IP "\fB5.\fR   c(n) = 3 log(n)" 4
.IX Item "5.   c(n) = 3 log(n)"
.IP "\fB6.\fR   c(n) = 0" 4
.IX Item "6.   c(n) = 0"
.PD
.PP
Use the numbers above with the \fI\-S\fR option to indicate which information criterion
you want to use.  If you use penalty functions 1 through 5 above, then you should also
specify a threshold of 0.0 with the \fI\-L\fR function.   Penalty function 6 is equivalent to
no penalty function and requires an experimentwise threshold value that might be obtained 
via a permutation test. 
.Sh "\s-1ANALYSIS\s0 \s-1PHASE\s0"
.IX Subsection "ANALYSIS PHASE"
\&\fBMImapqtl\fR can read a genetic model and proced with various tasks as explained above.  This
leads to the idea of repeating the analysis with the results of a previous run of the program.
One can think of doing the analysis in steps or \fIphases\fR.   The default is to set the phase
to zero.  If the phase is set to zero, then the default input file for a genetic model is
\&\fIqtlcart.eqt\fR, the output is \fIqtlcart.mqt\fR and the general output file is \fIqtlcart.mim\fR.
At the end of the analysis, the phase remains 0.  
.PP
If one sets the phase to a positive integer (generally starting with 1), then the default
input is to assume that input and output files follow a rule.   Assume the filename stem is
\&\fIqtlcart\fR and the phase is \fIi\fR.   The input genetic model will be set to \fIqtlcartPhase\fRi\-1\fI.mqt\fR,
the output genetic model will be written to \fIqtlcartPhase\fRi\fI.mqt\fR, and the general output file
will be \fIqtlcartPhase\fRi\fI.mim\fR.  At the end of the analysis, the phase variable \fIi\fR will be 
incremented by one and recorded in the \fIqtlcart.rc\fR file.  This makes it easier for the
program (and the user) to keep track of previous and current results.  Also note that if 
you used an \fBR\fR in position 7 of the workcode, then the output file containing a new
dataset with the residuals replacing the trait values will be put in \fIqtlcartPhase\fRi\fI.res\fR.
.SH "EXAMPLES"

Calculates the best model for  the dataset in \fIqtlcart.cro\fR
using the map in \fIqtlcart.map\fR and the model in \fIqtlcart.eqt\fR, but only searches for 
main effects (additive and dominance).
.PP
Here is a sequence using the example dataset \fImletest.cro\fR along with its map file \fImletest.map\fR,
both of which come with the programs.  Assume that these two files have been placed in an
empty subdirectory which is now the current working directory.

.PP
The first invocation sets the filename stem, the information criterion and threshold for adding
parameters and indicates that it is phase 1.   The \fB\-I\fR option tells \fBMImapqtl\fR to search for
additive \s-1QTL\s0.   The second invocation tests each \s-1QTL\s0 found in the first phase.  The third step
refines the positions of all remaining \s-1QTL\s0.  The fourth step searches for more \s-1QTL\s0 (and probably 
won't find any).  The fifth step searches for interactions between the identified putative \s-1QTL\s0.  
The phase variable is updated after each step, so \fBMImapqtl\fR knows where to find the
results from the previous step.

We are still doing some simulations to determine the best information criterion to use.
At present, the defaut of 1 with a threshold of 0.0 seems to work well for a variety of
data sets.  If the defaut detects no \s-1QTL\s0, then you might try information criteria 2, 3 or 6.

.IX Header "BUGS"
Still under development:  We hope to add the joint analysis of multiple traits in multiple 
environments.  We are also working on the output formats.

The \fBA\fR option for refining positions in the work code does not yet behave correctly.
It tends to place all putative \s-1QTL\s0 at the left flanking marker of an interval.  If you
use this option, then re-run \fBMImapqtl\fR with an \fBR\fR in position four to better refine the
position estimate of the \s-1QTL\s0.
