.IX Title ""<STANDARD INPUT>" 1"
.TH "<STANDARD INPUT>" 1 "Prune" "QTL Cartographer v1.17" "User Contributed Perl Documentation"
.SH "NAME"
Prune \- Prune or resample the data set.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBPrune\fR [ \fB\-o\fR \fIoutput\fR ] [ \fB\-i\fR \fIinput\fR ] [ \fB\-m\fR \fImapfile\fR ]
[ \fB\-I\fR \fIinteractive\fR ] [ \fB\-M\fR \fIModel\fR ] [ \fB\-b\fR \fIsimflag\fR ]  
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBPrune\fR allows one to eliminate markers or traits.  It removes the data from
the file containing the cross and reconstructs the molecular map.
It requires a molecular map that could be a random one produced by 
\&\fBRmap\fR,  or a real one in the same format as the output of 
\&\fBRmap\fR.   The sample could be a randomly generated one from 
\&\fBRcross\fR or a real one in the same format as the output of 
\&\fBRcross\fR. 
.PP
\&\fBPrune\fR also does bootstraps, permutations and simulations of missing or dominant markers.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
See \fB\f(BIQTLcart\fB\|(1)\fR for more information on the global options
\&\fB\-h\fR for help, \fB\-A\fR for automatic,  \fB\-V\fR for non-Verbose
\&\fB\-W path\fR for a working directory, \fB\-R file\fR to specify a resource
file, \fB\-e\fR to specify the log file, \fB\-s\fR to specify a seed for the
random number generator and \fB\-X stem\fR to specify a filename stem. 
The options below are specific to this program.
.PP
If you use this program without specifying any options, then you will
get into a menu that allows you to set them interactively.   
.IP "\fB\-o\fR" 4
.IX Item "-o"
This requires a filename stem for output.   \fBPrune\fR will overwrite the file ending in
\&\fI.crb\fR   if it exists, and create a new file if it does not.   If not used, then \fBPrune\fR will use
\&\fIqtlcart.crb\fR.  If the map is recreated, then a new map file will be written to
\&\fIqtlcart.mpb\fR by default or a file ending in mpb with the specified stem.
.IP "\fB\-i\fR" 4
.IX Item "-i"
This requires an input filename.    This file must exist.  It should be in the
same format as the output of \fBRcross\fR. The default file is \fIqtlcart.cro\fR. 
.IP "\fB\-m\fR" 4
.IX Item "-m"
\&\fBPrune\fR requires a genetic linkage map.  This option requires
the name of a file containing the map.  It should be in the same format
that \fBRmap\fR outputs.  The default file is \fIqtlcart.map\fR. 
.IP "\fB\-I\fR" 4
.IX Item "-I"
Sets the interactive level.  A zero means  that Prune will do what it needs to
without asking (the default for bootstraps, permutations or missing data simulations).
A one means that the user will be put into a repeating loop to manipulate the 
data set.    It has a value 1 by default, but using the \fB\-b\fR option disables it.
.IP "\fB\-M\fR" 4
.IX Item "-M"
This
sets a level for the elimination of individuals with this much missing marker
data, or for the simulation of missing or dominant markers when used with the \fB\-b\fR option.
.IP "\fB\-b\fR" 4
.IX Item "-b"
\&\fBPrune\fR will read in the map and data file and do one of \fB\s-1AUTOMATIC\s0 \s-1ACTIONS\s0\fR 
described in the section of the same name below.  A value of zero means that 
this option is ignored.
.IP "\fB\-t\fR" 4
.IX Item "-t"
Set the trait to process if using \fB\-b 7\fR.   
.SH "INPUT FORMAT"
.IX Header "INPUT FORMAT"
The input format of the molecular map should be the same as that of the
output format from the program \fBRmap\fR.   The input format of the
individual data should be the same as the output format of the program
\&\fBRcross\fR.
.SH "AUTOMATIC ACTIONS"
.IX Header "AUTOMATIC ACTIONS"
There are a number of automatic actions that can be performed using
the \fB\-b\fR option.   You will use one of the numbers below with the
option to tell \fBPrune\fR to do that action.   A new dataset is then printed
to a file \fIstem.crb\fR, where \fIstem\fR is the filename stem.  Note that
if you give a nonzero value to this option, the interactive flag is
turned off.  
.IP "1." 4
Perform a bootstrap resampling
of the data.   Sampling of individuals is done with replacement to
create a sample of the same size as the original.  
.IP "2." 4
Permute the the traits against genotype arrays.  If there are multiple traits
in the data set, then each trait will be shuffled against the genotype arrays.  
.IP "3." 4
Simulate missing markers.
The percent of missing marker data should be specified with the \fB\-M\fR option, and it
should be an number in the range of 0 to 100 percent. 
.IP "4." 4
Simulate dominant markers.  
The percent of dominant  marker data should be specified with the \fB\-M\fR option, and it
should be an number in the range of 0 to 100 percent.    The direction of dominance is
random.    
.IP "5." 4
Simulate selective genotyping.    
The percent of typed individuals should be specified with the \fB\-M\fR option, and it
should be an number in the range of 0 to 100 percent.    This will print out individuals with
trait values in the tails of the overall distribution.   The value specified will be the sum
of these tails:  Each tail will have half of the total.   This will apply to whichever
trait was last analyzed, or trait 1 if all the traits had been analyzed.   It is probably
best to do this with single trait data sets.   
.IP "6." 4
Permute the the traits against genotype arrays.  A value of 12 does this as well.
 If there are multiple traits
in the data set, then entire trait arrays will be shuffled against the genotype arrays.  
This contrasts with option 2 above which permutes the traits independently.   If 
you think the traits are correlated and you want to maintain that correlation, use this
option.  Otherwise, use option 2.  
.IP "7." 4
Prune the data back to one trait.   Use the \fB\-t\fR option with a trait number to select the trait.
The output will have one trait:  All individuals with missing values for this
trait will also be deleted.    
.IP "8." 4
Prune the data to specified traits.   Use the \fB\-t\fR option with a trait number to select the trait.
If the original data has \fIt\fR traits, then an integer in the range \fI[1,t]\fR will eliminate all 
but the specified trait, that is it will do exactly the same thing as option 7 above.  If an integer
less than one is used, then only traits whose names begin with a plus sign will remain in the
output.  If greater than the number of traits, then any trait  whose name begins with a 
minus sign will be eliminated.   Once the traits are eliminated, all individuals with missing data
for any of the surviving traits will also be deleted.   
.IP "9." 4
Remove all categorical trait information.   This is for compatibility 
with R/QTL, which can not read categorical trait information as of
8 June 2004.
.IP "10." 4
.IX Item "10."
Collapse the genetic linkage map and data.   If you have a large number of markers
and infer a genetic linkage map from a small sample, then there will be a lot of
intermarker distances of 0.0.   For all neighboring markers A and B with zero
intermarker distance, A will be replaced with B and all data combined.  (The marker
arrays should be identical except for missing data).

The \fB\-b\fR option creates a new sample from the old.  The new sample is
created by resampling the original sample with replacement.  Phenotypes
and genotypes are kept together.   The new sample will have the same sample
size as the old one. It will be written to \fIexout.crb\fR.  No new map 
will be written.

.PP
Here, the \fB\-b\fR option tells \fBPrune\fR to selectively genotype.   We specify 
20.0 percent with the \fB\-M\fR option meaning that those individuals with trait
values falling in the lower and upper 10 percent tails are retained, and the
middle 80 percent are removed.   
.PP
Suppose you have a large set of markers (say 5,000) and a data set of 100.
The sample size is too low for you to observe any recombinant events between
many pairs of markers.  You can reestimate the genetic linkage map with \fBEmap\fR and
then use \fBPrune\fR to trim out markers that appear to be redundant.   Suppose the
data are in \fIcross.inp\fR and the genetic linkage map is in \fImap.inp\fR.  The map file
must have the correct marker order, but need not have the correct intermarker distances.
.PP

will produce files \fIqtlcart.mpb\fR and \fIqtlcart.crb\fR that have a reduced number of
markers but the maximal amount of marker data.   
.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
You can eliminate multiple markers in the interactive loop.  You should
be aware that the order marker elimination is important.  If all
the markers to be eliminated are on separate chromosomes, the order is
unimportant.  If two markers from the same chromosome are to be eliminated,
order should be to eliminate the highest numbered marker.
The same concept holds for
traits:  eliminate them in the order of highest to lowest.
.PP
Do not try to eliminate any markers or traits \s-1AND\s0
do a bootstrap, permutation or simulation of missing markers in the same run.
