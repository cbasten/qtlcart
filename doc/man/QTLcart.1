.IX Title ""<STANDARD INPUT>" 1"
.TH "<STANDARD INPUT>" 1 "QTLcart" "QTL Cartographer v1.17" "User Contributed Perl Documentation"
.SH "NAME"
QTLcart \- A rudimentary front end for the QTL Cartographer system.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.IX Header "SYNOPSIS"
\&\fBQTLcart\fR	[ \fB\-h\fR ] [ \fB\-V\fR ] [ \fB\-A\fR ] [ \fB\-s\fR \fIseed\fR ]
	[ \fB\-W\fR \fIworkdir\fR ] [ \fB\-X\fR \fIstem\fR ]
	[ \fB\-e\fR \fIlogfile\fR ] [ \fB\-R\fR \fIresource\fR ]   
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
\&\fBQTLcart\fR  exists but does nothing at this time.   It is intended to be
the front end to a set of programs collectively known as
\&\s-1QTL\s0 Cartographer.   This man page explains the options that
are valid in all the programs of the \s-1QTL\s0 Cartographer suite.  It also 
outlines how to get started using the programs.  
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
The following options can be used with any of the programs in the
\&\s-1QTL\s0 Cartographer suite.  
.IP "\fB\-h\fR" 4
.IX Item "-h"
Prints out the current values of all program options, and information
on what the program does.  It then exits. 
.IP "\fB\-V\fR" 4
.IX Item "-V"
Turns the verbosity mode off.  The programs in the suite print out
messages while running.  This option turns off those messages.  This is 
useful for batch files.
.IP "\fB\-A\fR" 4
.IX Item "-A"
Skips the interactive screen for setting options.  All programs start up
with a menu that allows setting of options.  This turns the menu off.
It is also very useful for batch files.
.IP "\fB\-R\fR" 4
.IX Item "-R"
The programs will read the default parameters from a file specified with
this option. If a file called \fIqtlcart.rc\fR is in the current working directory, 
it will be opened by default and all parameter values read.  If no such file exists, then
default parameter values will be assumed, and the file will be created.
.Sp
It is probably better to simply rename a resource file \fIqtlcart.rc\fR than to
use this option.
.IP "\fB\-W\fR" 4
.IX Item "-W"
This option allows one to set the work directory.  This directory must exist.
All the input files must be in this directory  and the output files will be
placed there.
.IP "\fB\-s\fR" 4
.IX Item "-s"
This requires a long integer to act as the random number seed. 
By default,  it is the value returned by the \s-1ANSI\s0 C function \fI\fItime()\fI\fR,
which is usually the number of seconds since some
arbitrary past date (often 1 January 1970).   This number will also be used
as a unique identifer on the first line of the output file.  
.Sp
This can be a useful option.   It is recorded in the log file when any 
program is run.  It is possible to recreate exactly what was done using the
log file.  
.IP "\fB\-e\fR" 4
.IX Item "-e"
This requires a filename for the log file.   It will be appended to if
it exists and created if not.   The default is \fIqtlcart.log\fR. 
.IP "\fB\-X\fR" 4
.IX Item "-X"
Give a filename stem.  All output will start with this stem and have
extensions indicating what is in them.
.IP "\fB\-D\fR" 4
.IX Item "-D"
Is a debugging option.   It can be followed by a number to indicate the 
level of debugging output.   For example, \fB\-D0\fR indicates no debugging 
output and is the default.   \fB\-D1\fR and \fB\-D2\fR will cause some of the programs to 
output extra information to the log file.   \fB\-D3\fR will cause the programs
to create a file \fImemacct.txt\fR and record all allocation and deallocation of 
memory.   
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.IX Header "EXAMPLES"
For all the following examples, assume that \fBQTLCart\fR is just a wildcard
for any of the programs in the suite.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        % QTLcart -R resource.file
.Ve
.PP
\&\fBQTLcart\fR 
will read option values from the file resource.file.  The other programs
do this, and except for  
\&\fBPreplot\fR, 
will regenerate the file upon exit.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        % QTLcart -X corn
.Ve
.PP
Will set the filename stem to \fIcorn\fR.   The output files will then have 
names beginning with \fIcorn\fR and logical extensions.  For example, the
map file will be placed in \fIcorn.map\fR and the file containing the data from
a cross will be in \fIcorn.cro\fR.   Filenaming conventions should follow the old
\&\s-1DOS\s0 8+3 rule due to historical reasons.	
.SH "GLOBAL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS"
.IX Header "GLOBAL COMMAND LINE OPTIONS"
All the parameters for \fBQTLcart\fR are also parameters for the other
programs in the \s-1QTL\s0 Cartographer system.
.SH "GLOBAL BEHAVIOR"
.IX Header "GLOBAL BEHAVIOR"
All the programs in the \s-1QTL\s0 Cartographer suite behave in the same 
general way.  They were originally \s-1UNIX\s0 programs and can be run as 
such (using command line options).  More recently, we have added an
interactive menu that allows the user to set parameters.  Once inside
any of the programs, all the parameters of the program are displayed
with their current values.  The user chooses whichever parameter 
he or she wishes to change by selecting a number.  The menu is in 
a loop.  Choosing 0 will end the loop and proceed with the current
parameter values.  
.PP
The menu is also where one can get online help.  Online help will be
a numbered option in the list of parameters.  Choose it and specify the
location of the help file if the program couldn't find it.  
.PP
When the programs begin to run, they will print out their parameter 
values to a log file (\fIqtlcart.log\fR by default).  
.PP
Here is an example of the \fBRcross\fR menu:
.PP

.Ve
.PP
This menu is in a loop.   To change a parameter, select its number and press
return.  You will be prompted for a new value or filename.   You can clear
out a filename or working directory by inputting a single period (.).   When 
satisfied that the parameters are set correctly, you can select 0 to run the
program.   If you want to quit without changing the resource file, simply select 17.   
Selecting 18 will update the resource file with any parameter changes you have made.
.PP
Each program will have a different number of parameters, thus the last five options
may not have the same numbering as in the \fBRcross\fR example above.   In addition,
\&\fBRmap\fR, \fBRqtl\fR and \fBRcross\fR have options that only make sense if you
are simulating data.   These options disappear if you set an input file to translate
and thus the last five options are renumbered.   
.SH "RESOURCE FILE"
.IX Header "RESOURCE FILE"
The resource file keeps track of the most current parameter values used in the
programs.  Each time the user runs a program, the program accepts new values
for parameters and writes them to the resource file.  This is unlike the log
file which keeps track of the parameters used at the time of running each
program. The resource file that is generated by the programs in the suite is self
documenting.  Look in the \fIqtlcart.rc\fR file.
.SH "WORKING DIRECTORY"
.IX Header "WORKING DIRECTORY"
You can specify a working directory (or folder) with the \fB\-W\fR option.  This
directory
(folder) must exist prior to running any of the programs.  The directory can be
relative or complete, and should have the standard directory delimiter appended
to it.  For example
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        -W /home/user/qtlcart/work/
.Ve
.PP
would use \fI/home/user/qtlcart/work\fR as the working directory.  All input and ouput
files would have to be in this directory.  For a Windows system, the line might be
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        -W c:\eqtlcart\ework\e
.Ve
.PP
whereas a Macintosh would require
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        -W HardDrive:qtlcart:work:
.Ve
.PP
The equivalent line in the resource file would have \fB\-workdir\fR instead of just
\&\fB\-W\fR.   
.PP
In \s-1UNIX\s0, you can set a path variable pointing to the programs and simply set your
current working directory to the working directory.   For Mac, you double click
the icons and should use a working directory variable.   Relative paths are
also possible.   For example, if the programs reside in a \fIbin\fR folder in
the \fIqtlcart\fR folder on a Macintosh, then you can have a \fIdata\fR folder in
the \fIqtlcart\fR folder and use
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        -W ::data:
.Ve
.PP
as the working directory.  The two colons mean go up one level and then go into
the \fIdata\fR folder.
.PP
On a Windows system, you can either open a command window and type in commands
as you would under \s-1UNIX\s0, or double click program icons as you would on a Macintosh.
If you use the Macintosh mode, then you will need to set a working directory as
the resource file is saved in the same directory where the binaries reside.
If you use the command line mode, then you should have the binary directory
in the \s-1PATH\s0 variable so that you can run the programs in the working directory
and not have to set that variable. 
.PP
Newer versions of the Macintosh have \s-1UNIX\s0 underneath the windowing system.
\&\s-1QTL\s0 Cartographer can be compiled and used in the \s-1UNIX\s0 enviroment on the Macintosh
as under any \s-1UNIX\s0 system.   You will need to get the developer package and install
it on your Macintosh to do this.
.SH "FILENAME STEM"
.IX Header "FILENAME STEM"
The filename stem is an important concept in the usage of this package.  Beginning with
version 1.12, the  programs utilize the filename stem \fIqtlcart\fR.
All files are then named using this stem and filename extensions relevant to 
the filetype.   For example, if the \fB\-X\fR option is followed by \fIcorn\fR,
then when new files are created, they will have the stem \fIcorn\fR
followed by a logical extension.  An example would be  \fIcorn.map\fR  for a genetic linkage map.
With some practice, you will be able to know the contents of a file by its extension.
.SH "USING THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS"
.IX Header "USING THE INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS"
For now it is best to use the individual programs rather than the front
end.  If you have no data, then you would use the programs in the 
following order:
.IP "1." 4
\&\fBRmap\fR,  to create a random map of markers.
.IP "2." 4
\&\fBRqtl\fR, to generate a random genetic model for the map.
.IP "3." 4
\&\fBRcross\fR, to create a random cross.
.IP "4." 4
\&\fBLRmapqtl\fR, to do a simple linear regression of the data on the markers.
.IP "5." 4
\&\fBSRmapqtl\fR, to do a stepwise linear regression of the data on the markers to rank the markers.
.IP "6." 4
\&\fBZmapqtl\fR, to do interval or composite interval mapping.
.IP "7." 4
\&\fBPreplot\fR,  to reformat the output of the analysis for \fB\s-1GNUPLOT\s0\fR.
.IP "8." 4
\&\fB\s-1GNUPLOT\s0\fR, to see the results graphically.
.PP
If you have  data, then you might use the programs in the 
following order:
.IP "1." 4
\&\fBRmap\fR, to reformat the output of \s-1MAPMAKER\s0 or a standard input file.
.IP "2." 4
\&\fBRcross\fR, to reformat your data.
.IP "3." 4
\&\fBQstats\fR, to summarize missing data and calculate some basic statistics on your
quantitative traits.
.IP "4." 4
\&\fBLRmapqtl\fR, to do a simple linear regression of the data on the markers.
.IP "5." 4
\&\fBSRmapqtl\fR, to do a stepwise linear regression of the data on the markers to rank the markers.
This should be run with model 2.
.IP "6." 4
\&\fBZmapqtl\fR,  to do interval or composite interval mapping.  This should be run twice,
once with model 3 and a second time with model 6.
.IP "7." 4
\&\fBPreplot\fR,  to reformat the output of the analysis for Gnuplot.
.IP "8." 4
\&\fB\s-1GNUPLOT\s0\fR, to see the results graphically.
.PP
We recommend that the new user tries a simulation to gain an understanding of the
programs

Many \s-1UNIX\s0 systems have been known to get upset when trying to 
run the \s-1QTL\s0 Cartographer programs from out of the front end. 
It has something to do with the memory management.  Try running
the individual programs one by one.  A good test is to simply 
run each program without changing any parameters.
